"<p class=\"description\">The advances in and applications of x-ray and neutron crystallography form the essence of this new edition of this classic textbook, while maintaining the overall plan of the book that has been well received in the academic community since the first edition in 1977. X-ray crystallography is a universal tool for studying molecular structure, and the complementary nature of neutron diffraction crystallography permits the location of atomic species in crystals which are not easily revealed by X-ray techniques alone, such as hydrogen atoms or other light atoms in the presence of heavier atoms. Thus, a chapter discussing the practice of neutron diffraction techniques, with examples, broadens the scope of the text in a highly desirable way. As with previous editions, the book contains problems to illustrate the work of each chapter, and detailed solutions are provided. Mathematical procedures related to the material of the main body of the book are not discussed in detail, but are quoted where needed with references to standard mathematical texts. To address the computational aspect of crystallography, the suite of computer programs from the fourth edition has been revised and expanded. The programs enable the reader to participate fully in many of the aspects of x-ray crystallography discussed in the book. In particular, the program system XRAY* is interactive, and enables the reader to follow through, at the monitor screen, the computational techniques involved in single-crystal structure determination, albeit in two dimensions, with the data sets provided.Exercises for students can be found int the book, and solutions are available to instructors.</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">Bioinformatics is a relatively new field of research. It evolved from the requirement to process, characterize, and apply the information being produced by DNA sequencing technology. The production of DNA sequence data continues to grow exponentially. At the same time, improved bioinformatics such as faster DNA sequence search methods have been combined with increasingly powerful computer systems to process this information. Methods are being developed for the ever more detailed quantification of gene expression, providing an insight into the function of the newly discovered genes, while molecular genetic tools provide a link between these genes and heritable traits. Genetic tests are now available to determine the likelihood of suffering specific ailments and can predict how plant cultivars may respond to the environment. The steps in the translation of the genetic blueprint to the observed phenotype is being increasingly understood through proteome, metabolome and phenome analysis, all underpinned by advances in bioinformatics. Bioinformatics is becoming increasingly central to the study of biology, and a day at a computer can often save a year or more in the laboratory. The volume is intended for graduate-level biology students as well as researchers who wish to gain a better understanding of applied bioinformatics and who wish to use bioinformatics technologies to assist in their research. The volume would also be of value to bioinformatics developers, particularly those from a computing background, who would like to understand the application of computational tools for biological research. Each chapter would include a comprehensive introduction giving an overview of the fundamentals, aimed at introducing graduate students and researchers from diverse backgrounds to the field and bring them up-to-date on the current state of knowledge. To accommodate the broad range of topics in applied bioinformatics, chapters have been grouped into themes: gene and genome analysis, molecular genetic analysis, gene expression analysis, protein and proteome analysis, metabolome analysis, phenome data analysis, literature mining and bioinformatics tool development. Each chapter and theme provides an introduction to the biology behind the data describes the requirements for data processing and details some of the methods applied to the data to enhance biological understanding.</p>"

"<p>Epigenetics has emerged recently as an important area of molecular biological studies. Epigenetic modifications lead to potentially heritable but reversible alterations in the expression of genes that determine cell fate. Epigenetic misregulation is thus often linked to degenerative diseases, cancer and neuronal disorders. Recent biomedical interest in this regulatory system stems from the fact that epigenetic, in contrast to genetic, alterations are in principle amenable to pharmacological intervention. A few epigenetically active drugs, for example histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors, have been approved by FDA for treatment of cancers such as CTCL, MDS, and AML. This volume explores the scientific background for clinical applications of epigenetically active drugs. Included are descriptions of epigenetic controls over gene expression, the post-transcriptional silencing of genes by RNA interference (RNAi) and microRNAs, as well as new findings from stem cell research which are relevant to pharmacological applications.</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">When Dr. Frank C. Whitmore was president of the American Chemical Society in 1938 and made the customary tour of local ACS sections, he used that occasion to spread the gospel of the electron theory of valence. At one of his lectures the author of this book sat in the audience among a mixed group of chemists consisting of technicians, students, and college graduates. The lack of familiarity of organic chemists with the electron was so obvious that it aroused in the author an urge to write an elementary introduction to organic chemistry in which the role of the electron would be emphasized.  This book is especially intended to serve two groups of readers: those engaged in work of a chemical nature who are not able to take a classroom course in organic chemistry, and those in a college course who find they have a need for a supplementary book to help clarify the approach to modern organic chemistry. In other words, the book was conceived as an integrated introduction to both electron-valence theory and organic chemistry at a level suitable for self-study.  The first edition of this book appeared in 1943 during World War II. A second edition, much enlarged, was published in 1955. For this third edition the book has been extensively rewritten, and more than enough material has been added so that it can serve as a textbook for a one-year college course. The novel arrangement of the subject matter in the earlier editions has been maintained. A teacher who prefers to lecture largely from his own notes should find no difficulty incorporating his material into the simple plan on which this book is based.</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">One approach to organic synthesis is retrosynthetic analysis. With this approach chemists start with the structures of their target molecules and progressively cut bonds to create simpler molecules. Reversing this process gives a synthetic route to the target molecule from simpler starting materials. This \"disconnection\" approach to synthesis is now a fundamental part of every organic synthesis course. Workbook for Organic Synthesis: The Disconnection Approach, 2nd Edition This workbook provides a comprehensive graded set of problems to illustrate and develop the themes of each of the chapters in the textbook \"Organic Synthesis: The Disconnection Approach, 2nd Edition.\" Each problem is followed by a fully explained solution and discussion. The examples extend the student's experience of the types of molecules being synthesised by organic chemists, and the strategies they employ to control their syntheses. By working through these examples students will develop their skills in analysing synthetic challenges, and build a toolkit of strategies for planning new syntheses. Examples are drawn from pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, natural products, pheromones, perfumery and flavouring compounds, dyestuffs, monomers, and intermediates used in more advanced synthetic work. Reasons for wishing to synthesise each compound are given. Together the workbook and textbook provide a complete course in retrosynthetic analysis. Organic Synthesis: The Disconnection Approach, 2nd Edition There are forty chapters in \"Organic Synthesis: The Disconnection Approach, 2nd Edition\" those on the synthesis of given types of molecules alternate with strategy chapters in which the methods just learnt are placed in a wider context. The synthesis chapters cover many ways of making each type of molecule starting with simple aromatic and aliphatic compounds with one functional group and progressing to molecules with many functional groups. The strategy chapters cover questions of selectivity, protection, stereochemistry, and develop more advanced thinking via reagents specifically designed for difficult problems. In its second edition updated examples and techniques are included and illustrated additional material has been added to take the student to the level required by the sequel, \"Organic Synthesis: Strategy and Control.\" Several chapters contain extensive new material based on courses that the authors give to chemists in the pharmaceutical industry. \"Workbook for Organic Synthesis: The Disconnection Approach, 2nd edition,\" combined with the main textbook, provides a full course in retrosynthetic analysis for chemistry and biochemistry students, and a refresher course for organic chemists working in industry and academia.</p>"

Together with Part A: Structure and Mechanisms, the two volumes are intended to provide the advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate student in chemistry with a sufficient foundation to comprehend and use the research literature in organic chemistry.</p>"
"<p class=\"description\">As quantum theory enters its second century, it is fitting to examine just how far it has come as a tool for the chemist. Beginning with Max Planck’s agonizing conclusion in 1900 that linked energy emission in discreet bundles to the resultant black-body radiation curve, a body of knowledge has developed with profound consequences in our ability to understand nature. In the early years, quantum theory was the providence of physicists and certain breeds of physical chemists. While physicists honed and refined the theory and studied atoms and their component systems, physical chemists began the foray into the study of larger, molecular systems. Quantum theory predictions of these systems were first verified through experimental spectroscopic studies in the electromagnetic spectrum (microwave, infrared and ultraviolet/visible), and, later, by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Over two generations these studies were hampered by two major drawbacks: lack of resolution of spectroscopic data, and the complexity of calculations. This powerful theory that promised understanding of the fundamental nature of molecules faced formidable challenges. The following example may put things in perspective for today’s chemistry faculty, college seniors or graduate students: As little as 40 years ago, force field calculations on a molecule as simple as ketene was a four to five year dissertation project.</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">Since its original appearance in 1977, Advanced Organic Chemistry has found wide use as a text providing broad coverage of the structure, reactivity and synthesis of organic compounds. The Fourth Edition provides updated material but continues the essential elements of the previous edition. The material in Part A is organized on the basis of fundamental structural topics such as structure, stereochemistry, conformation and aromaticity and basic mechanistic types, including nucleophilic substitution, addition reactions, carbonyl chemistry, aromatic substitution and free radical reactions. The material in Part B is organized on the basis of reaction type with emphasis on reactions of importance in laboratory synthesis. As in the earlier editions, the text contains extensive references to both the primary and review literature and provides examples of data and reactions that illustrate and document the generalizations. While the text assumes completion of an introductory course in organic chemistry, it reviews the fundamental concepts for each topic that is discussed. The Fourth Edition updates certain topics that have advanced rapidly in the decade since the Third Edition was published, including computational chemistry, structural manifestations of aromaticity, enantioselective reactions and lanthanide catalysis. The two parts stand alone, although there is considerable cross-referencing. Part A emphasizes quantitative and qualitative description of structural effects on reactivity and mechanism. Part B emphasizes the most general and useful synthetic reactions. The focus is on the core of organic chemistry, but the information provided forms the foundation for future study and research in medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry, biological chemistry and physical properties of organic compounds.

"<p class=\"description\">Envisioning the first book of the bible like no one before him, R. Crumb, the legendary illustrator, reveals here the story of Genesis in a profoundly honest and deeply moving way. Originally thinking that we would do a take off of Adam and Eve, Crumb became so fascinated by the Bible's language, \"a text so great and so strange that it lends itself readily to graphic depictions,\" that he decided instead to do a literal interpretation using the text word for word in a version primarily assembled from the translations of Robert Alter and the King James bible. Now, readers of every persuasion--Crumb fans, comic book lovers, and believers--can gain astonishing new insights from these harrowing, tragic, and even juicy stories. Crumb's Book of Genesis reintroduces us to the bountiful tree lined garden of Adam and Eve, the massive ark of Noah with beasts of every kind, the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah destroyed by brimstone and fire that rained from the heavens, and the Egypt of the Pharaoh, where Joseph's embalmed body is carried in a coffin, in a scene as elegiac as any in Genesis. Using clues from the text and peeling away the theological and scholarly interpretation that have often obscured the Bible's most dramatic stories, Crumb fleshes out a parade of Biblical originals: from the serpent in Eden, the humanoid reptile appearing like an alien out of a science fiction movie, to Jacob, a \"kind've depressed guy who doesn't strike you as physically courageous,\" and his bother, Esau, \"a rough and kick ass guy,\" to Abraham's wife Sarah, more fetching than most woman at 90, to God himself, \"a standard Charlton Heston-like figure with long white hair and a flowing beard.\" As Crumb writes in his introduction, \"the stories of these people, the Hebrews, were something more than just stories. They were the foundation, the source, in writing of religious and political power, handed down by God himself.\" Crumb's Book of Genesis, the culmination of 5 years of painstaking work, is a tapestry of masterly detail and storytelling which celebrates the astonishing diversity of the one of our greatest artistic geniuses.

His small act of kindness propels him into a world he never dreamed existed. There are people who fall through the cracks, and Richard has become one of them. And he must learn to survive in this city of shadows and darkness, monsters and saints, murderers and angels, if he is ever to return to the London that he knew.</p><h3>Amazon.com Review</h3><p><em>Neverwhere</em>'s protagonist, Richard Mayhew, learns the hard way that no good deed goes unpunished. He ceases to exist in the ordinary world of London Above, and joins a quest through the dark and dangerous London Below, a shadow city of lost and forgotten people, places, and times. His companions are Door, who is trying to find out who hired the assassins who murdered her family and why; the Marquis of Carabas, a trickster who trades services for very big favors; and Hunter, a mysterious lady who guards bodies and hunts only the biggest game. London Below is a wonderfully realized shadow world, and the story plunges through it like an express passing local stations, with plenty of action and a satisfying conclusion. The story is reminiscent of Douglas Adams's <em>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</em>, but Neil Gaiman's humor is much darker and his images sometimes truly horrific. Puns and allusions to everything from <em>Paradise Lost</em> to <em>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</em> abound, but you can enjoy the book without getting all of them. Gaiman is definitely not just for graphic-novel fans anymore. <em>--Nona Vero</em></p><h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Starred Review. Gaiman assumes the role of narrator for his latest book, offering an intimate reading that steals one's attention almost immediately and keeps the listener involved throughout. As the story is based in the United Kingdom, Gaiman is a quintessential raconteur for the tale, with his charming Scottish brogue instilling life and spirit into the central character of Richard Mayhew. Pitch perfect, with clear pronunciation, Gaiman invites listeners into his living room for a fireside chat, offering a private and personal experience that transcends the limitations of traditional narration. The author knows his story through and through, capturing the desired emotion and audience reaction in each and every scene. His characters are unique, with diverse personalities and narrative approaches, and Gaiman offers a variety of dialects and tones. The reading sounds more like a private conversation among friends with Gaiman providing the convincing and likable performance the writing deserves. <em>A Harper Perennial paperback (Reviews, May 19, 1997).

You’ll explore distributions, rules of probability, visualization, and many other tools and concepts.New chapters on regression, time series analysis, survival analysis, and analytic methods will enrich your discoveries.Develop an understanding of probability and statistics by writing and testing codeRun experiments to test statistical behavior, such as generating samples from several distributionsUse simulations to understand concepts that are hard to grasp mathematicallyImport data from most sources with Python, rather than rely on data that’s cleaned and formatted for statistics toolsUse statistical inference to answer questions about real-world data</p>"
"<p class=\"description\">During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression &amp; path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, projection pursuit and gradient boosting.</p>"
"<p class=\"description\">In recent years graph theory has emerged as a subject in its own right, as well as being an important mathematical tool in such diverse subjects as operational research, chemistry, sociology and genetics. Robin Wilson's book has been widely used as a text for undergraduate courses in mathematics, computer science and economics, and as a readable introduction to the subject for non-mathematicians.  The opening chapters provide a basic foundation course, containing definitions and examples, connectedness, Eulerian and Hamiltonian paths and cycles, and trees, with a range of applications. This is followed by two chapters on planar graphs and colouring, with special reference to the four-colour theorem. The next chapter deals with transversal theory and connectivity, with applications to network flows. A final chapter on matroid theory ties together material from earlier chapters, and an appendix discusses algorithms and their efficiency.</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">This text presents mathematical biology as a field with a unity of its own, rather than only the intrusion of one science into another. It updates an earlier successful edition and greatly expands the concept of the 'computer biology laboratory,' giving students a general perspective of the field before proceeding to more specialized topics. The book focuses on problems of contemporary interest, such as cancer, genetics, and the rapidly growing field of genomics. It includes new chapters on parasites, cancer, and phylogenetics, along with an introduction to online resources for DNA, protein lookups, and popular pattern matching tools such as BLAST. In addition, the emerging field of algebraic statistics is introduced and its power illustrated in the context of phylogenetics. A unique feature of the book is the integration of a computer algebra system into the flow of ideas in a supporting but unobtrusive role. Syntax for both the Maple and Matlab systems is provided in a tandem format. The use of a computer algebra system gives the students the opportunity to examine 'what if' scenarios, allowing them to investigate biological systems in a way never before possible. For students without access to Maple or Matlab, each topic presented is complete. Graphic visualizations are provided for all mathematical results. Mathematical Biology includes extensive exercises, problems and examples. A year of calculus with linear algebra is required to understand the material presented. The biology presented proceeds from the study of populations down to the molecular level; no previous coursework in biology is necessary. The book is appropriate for undergraduate and graduate students studying mathematics or biology and for scientists and researchers who wish to study the applications of mathematics and computers in the natural sciences.</p>"

Influenced by works such as Don Juan and the novels of Kafka, these essays begin with a meditation on suicide: the question of living or not living in an absurd universe devoid of order or meaning. With lyric eloquence, Camus posits a way out of despair, reaffirming the value of personal existence, and the possibility of life lived with dignity and authenticity.</p><p class=\"description\">Born in 1913 in Algeria, Albert Camus was a French novelist, dramatist, \nand essayist. He was deeply affected by the plight of the French during \nthe Nazi occupation of World War II, who were subject to the military's \narbitrary whims. He explored the existential human condition in such \nworks as L'Etranger (The Outsider, 1942) and Le Mythe de Sisyphe (The \nMyth of Sisyphus, 1942), which propagated the philosophical notion of \nthe \"absurd\" that was being given dramatic expression by other Theatre \nof the Absurd dramatists of the 1950s and 1960s.

"<div>The Bayesian method is the natural approach to inference, yet it is hidden from readers behind chapters of slow, mathematical analysis. The typical text on Bayesian inference involves two to three chapters on probability theory, then enters what Bayesian inference is. Unfortunately, due to mathematical intractability of most Bayesian models, the reader is only shown simple, artificial examples. This can leave the user with a so-what feeling about Bayesian inference. In fact, this was the author's own prior opinion. <div><br></div><div>After some recent success of Bayesian methods in machine-learning competitions, I decided to investigate the subject again. Even with my mathematical background, it took me three straight-days of reading examples and trying to put the pieces together to understand the methods. There was simply not enough literature bridging theory to practice. The problem with my misunderstanding was the disconnect between Bayesian mathematics and probabilistic programming. That being said, I suffered then so the reader would not have to now. This book attempts to bridge the gap.</div><div><br></div><div>If Bayesian inference is the destination, then mathematical analysis is a particular path to towards it. On the other hand, computing power is cheap enough that we can afford to take an alternate route via probabilistic programming. The latter path is much more useful, as it denies the necessity of mathematical intervention at each step, that is, we remove often-intractable mathematical analysis as a prerequisite to Bayesian inference. Simply put, this latter computational path proceeds via small intermediate jumps from beginning to end, where as the first path proceeds by enormous leaps, often landing far away from our target. Furthermore, without a strong mathematical background, the analysis required by the first path cannot even take place.</div><div><br></div><div>Bayesian Methods for Hackers is designed as an introduction to Bayesian inference from a computational/understanding-first, and mathematics-second, point of view. Of course as an introductory book, we can only leave it at that: an introductory book. For the mathematically trained, they may cure the curiosity this text generates with other texts designed with mathematical analysis in mind. For the enthusiast with less mathematical-background, or one who is not interested in the mathematics but simply the practice of Bayesian methods, this text should be sufficient and entertaining.</div><div>The choice of PyMC as the probabilistic programming language is two-fold. As of this writing, there is currently no central resource for examples and explanations in the PyMC universe. The official documentation assumes prior knowledge of Bayesian inference and probabilistic programming. We hope this book encourages users at every level to look at PyMC. Secondly, with recent core developments and popularity of the scientific stack in Python, PyMC is likely to become a core component soon enough. </div><div><br></div><div>PyMC does have dependencies to run, namely NumPy and (optionally) SciPy. To not limit the user, the examples in this book will rely only on PyMC, NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib only.</div></div>"

"<p class=\"description\">Between Moore's law and the notion of \"Internet time,\" we're constantly being bombarded with more and more information--most of it in the form of disorganized data. Turning this information into useful knowledge is getting harder and harder to do, and it takes time that we just don't have. The current economic situation hasn't helped either. With money spread thin, who hasn't had to take on new tasks and learn new things? And slashed training budgets mean there's little to rely on for learning except books- but learning a complex new programming language like Java from a book is no simple task. Maybe your boss is giving you two weeks to come up to speed for a project, or maybe you're ready to take that next step up in your current job, or be a more viable candidate for anewjob. Whatever the reason, the onus is on you to learn. All these factors make it more important than ever to have a way to learn--fast. And that's whatHead First Javadoes -- by exploiting the way your brain works, it compresses the time it takes to really learn. Why? Because its unique approach not only shows you what you need to know about Java syntax, it enables and encourages you to think like a Java programmer. Mastering object oriented programming requires a certain way of thinking, not just a certain way of writing code. The latest research in cognitive science, neurobiology, and educational psychology shows that learning at the deeper levels takes a lot more than text on a page. Actively combining words and pictures not only helps in understanding the subject, but in remembering it. According to some studies, an engaging, entertaining, image-rich, conversational approach actually teaches the subject better.Head First Javaputs these theories into practice with a vengeance. Chock full of mind stretching exercises, memorable analogies, and stories, humor and attitude that aren't just pasted-on distractions but that are used to drive home key points and make ideas come alive, the Head First approach is as effective as it is unique. It takes a pretty unique person to have developed such an innovative way to Learn Java. Kathy Sierra has been interested in learning theory since her days as a game designer. More recently, she's been a master trainer for Sun Microsystems, teaching Sun's own instructors how to teach the latest Java technologies. She has been actively using the concepts inHead First Javato teach hundreds of trainers, developers and even non programmers. She is the founder of one of the largest Java community websites in the world, javaranch.com, and she is a member of the development team for the Sun Certified programmer exam. Bert Bates is also a long-time Java developer and trainer with extensive experience in learning theory. His background features a long stint in artificial intelligence with clients like the Weather Channel, A&amp;E Network, Rockwell and Timken. IsHead First Javaright for you? That depends.Head First Javaassumes you're a programmer or at least have experience with scripting languages. It assumes that you're smart, that you're creative and open to new ideas, and that you know you're just not the type of person who wants to learn the traditional way.

"<div><div><div>WHY PYTHON?</div><div>When I began teaching computational physics, the first decision facing me\nwas “which language do I use?” With the sheer number of good program-\nming languages available, it was not an obvious choice.

"<p class=\"description\">Arduino boards have impressed both hackers and professional engineers. Whether you're a hobbyist or a professional, it isn't just a breadboard and a hazy idea that keeps you going. It's essential to institute a proper design, device instrumentation and, indeed, test your project thoroughly before committing to a particular prototype.  Practical Arduino Engineering begins by outlining the engineering process, from the basic requirements and preliminary design to prototyping and testing. Each and every chapter exemplifies this process and demonstrates how you can profit from the implementation solid engineering principles—regardless of whether you just play in your basement or you want to publicize and sell your devices. Arduino is a brilliant prototyping platform that allows users to test and iterate design ideas. Imitation by other Arduino makers, hackers and engineers often proves your design's popularity. Practical Arduino Engineering will teach you to follow the engineering process carefully; over time, you will be able to review and improve this process, and even extend its scope. Practical Arduino Engineering is not purely theoretical. In addition, you'll learn the process of hardware engineering as applicable to Arduino projects, and the importance of the process in each and every project presented in this book.  To set the stage, Practical Arduino Engineering begins by reviewing the Arduino software landscape, then shows how to set up an Arduino project for testing. Even if you already know your compiler toolchain and the basics of Arduino programming, this refresher course can help fill in the gaps and explain why your compiler may spit out certain error messages. Practical Arduino Engineering then gradually builds up the engineering process, from single devices like LCDs, potentiometers and GPS modules, to the integration of several modules into larger projects, such as a wireless temperature measurement system, and ultimately an entire robot.  The engineering projects become progressively more challenging throughout the first 4 engineering chapters. Next, you'll proceed with simple steps towards the first intelligent part of a robot: the object detector. You'll find yourself teaching your robot how to avoid very hot objects or insurmountable obstacles. The basic design requirements for a complete robot and, indeed, the detailed design and prototyping for robots can be extremely tricky, which is why engineering discipline is invaluable.  Practical Arduino Engineering then enters the world of domestic engineering by introducing home alarm systems—not quite as simple as they seem. A solid, robust system can only be built by following the engineering process detailed in previous chapters, and this section reinforces that process. You'll then take a step further in your Arduino engineering process: instrumentation and control, and some error messaging using GSM. Control is introduced via the Xbox controller, a very powerful piece of technology able to play a considerable role in robotics projects. Having already learned to control motion and to sense and avoid objects, you'll learn how to debug your Arduino projects of varying complexities via the hardware instrumentation software LabVIEW.  To complete the journey into Practical Arduino Engineering, you'll discover how to use a special Arduino board to rely on Bluetooth Mate Silver for control of domestic and mobile Arduino projects. Using Bluetooth Mate Silver, you'll learn to implement basic engineering design with almost any Arduino project, and be able to justify, build, debug, and extend Arduino-based designs using a solid engineering approach.  Please note: the print version of this title is black &amp; white; the eBook is full color. What you’ll learn Practical engineering principles: from collecting requirements onwards  To instrument Arduino hardware for debugging  To build stationary Arduino home projects with varying degrees of complexity  To construct Arduino-based robots and vary your design until an optimal solution is reached  To add instrumentation software to the hardware design process  How to move from being a good hacker to being a solid engineer   Who this book is for  This book is geared toward engineers and makers used to a rigorous approach to hardware hacking, Arduino hackers aiming to get to the next level, and Arduino hackers interested in instrumenting their projects using Arduino and other software.

"<p class=\"description\">This book is for students and professionals who are intrigued by the prospect of learning and using a powerful language that provides a rich infrastructure for creating programs. No programming knowledge is necessary to benefit from this book except for the section on Lua bindings, which requires some familiarity with the C programming language. A certain comfort level with command-line operations, text editing, and directory structures is assumed.Software developers who have experience with functions, strings, and associative arrays can skim Chapters 2 through 5 with the caveat that certain Lua colloquialisms are introduced there along with programming concepts.Throughout the text, sections pertaining to a particular operating system are clearly marked and can be skipped by readers working on a different platform.This book is organized to guide you through the basics of using Lua. Its structure is as follows:Installing Lua on your system (Chapter 1)Learning the fundamentals of programming in Lua (Chapters 2 through 10)Reviewing standard Lua functions (Chapter 11)Exploring application development with Lua using packages contributed by the community (Chapters 12 through 18)Using Lua's many community resources (Chapter 19)Chapters 2 through 10 each build on concepts that are presented in its predecessors, so a sequential reading of this part of the book is advised. The summary of Lua's built-in libraries contains examples that assume you have a good grasp of the materials presented in the first 10 chapters.Some of the libraries and techniques presented in Chapters 12 and 13 are needed in the remaining chapters of the book. Chapters 14 through 19 are relatively independent of one another and can be read out of sequence.You need surprisingly little in the way of computer resources to learn and use Lua. This book focuses on Windows and Unix-like (including Linux) systems, but any operating system that supports a command shell should be suitable. You'll need a text editor to prepare and save Lua scripts.If you choose to extend Lua with libraries written in a programming language like C, you'll need a suitable software development kit. Many of these kits are freely available on the Internet but, unlike Lua, they can consume prodigious amounts of disk space and memory.Chapter 18 discusses using Lua on a Palm Pilot. Even if you don't own or have access to one of these devices, this chapter shows how you can simulate one on the major desktop systems.</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">The book will be sub-divided into four primary sections: Linux Nuts &amp; Bolts, The Linux Kernel, The Linux Desktop, and Linux for the web. The sections address key topics that Linux programmers need to master along with newer challenges. Cross-compilation (the act of building software on one type of computer system with the intention that it run on a foreign target platform) is a classical issue for those working on Linux projects and has a number of generally accepted approaches for its solution. Contrast the classical cross-compilation with a newer issue of dynamic device insertion and removal (\"hotplug\"). The Project Utopia has seeded various technologies that allow for automated device detection and discovery to work correctly on Linux systems - in a way that rivals that already available to users of other common computing platforms. Today, a Linux user who plugs in a USB stick can reasonably expect to have it \"just work\". Part of the Desktop Linux section will discuss how to work with these technologies (D-BUS, hal, udev, etc.) in order to put such technological advancement to practical use. &lt;p&gt;    Unique features of the book include using emulation and virtualization technologies for kernel development and application testing. The discussion of key Linux projects such as Project Utopia, and the accessibility and internationalization capabilities present in the GNOME desktop represent a key value-add that will serve to give readers invaluable insight into how their applications code really fits in with the rest of the software stack.</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">In order to thoroughly understand what makes Linux tick and why it works so well on a wide variety of systems, you need to delve deep into the heart of the kernel. The kernel handles all interactions between the CPU and the external world, and determines which programs will share processor time, in what order. It manages limited memory so well that hundreds of processes can share the system efficiently, and expertly organizes data transfers so that the CPU isn't kept waiting any longer than necessary for the relatively slow disks.The third edition of Understanding the Linux Kernel takes you on a guided tour of the most significant data structures, algorithms, and programming tricks used in the kernel. Probing beyond superficial features, the authors offer valuable insights to people who want to know how things really work inside their machine. Important Intel-specific features are discussed. Relevant segments of code are dissected line by line. But the book covers more than just the functioning of the code; it explains the theoretical underpinnings of why Linux does things the way it does.This edition of the book covers Version 2.6, which has seen significant changes to nearly every kernel subsystem, particularly in the areas of memory management and block devices. The book focuses on the following topics:Memory management, including file buffering, process swapping, and Direct memory Access (DMA) The Virtual Filesystem layer and the Second and Third Extended FilesystemsProcess creation and schedulingSignals, interrupts, and the essential interfaces to device driversTimingSynchronization within the kernelInterprocess Communication (IPC) Program executionUnderstanding the Linux Kernel will acquaint you with all the inner workings of Linux, but it's more than just an academic exercise. You'll learn what conditions bring out Linux's best performance, and you'll see how it meets the challenge of providing good system response during process scheduling, file access, and memory management in a wide variety of environments. This book will help you make the most of your Linux system.</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">sed &amp; awk describes two text processing programs that are mainstays of the UNIX programmer's toolbox.sed is a \"stream editor\" for editing streams of text that might be too large to edit as a single file, or that might be generated on the fly as part of a larger data processing step. The most common operation done with sed is substitution, replacing one block of text with another.awk is a complete programming language. Unlike many conventional languages, awk is \"data driven\" -- you specify what kind of data you are interested in and the operations to be performed when that data is found. awk does many things for you, including automatically opening and closing data files, reading records, breaking the records up into fields, and counting the records. While awk provides the features of most conventional programming languages, it also includes some unconventional features, such as extended regular expression matching and associative arrays. sed &amp; awk describes both programs in detail and includes a chapter of example sed and awk scripts.This edition covers features of sed and awk that are mandated by the POSIX standard. This most notably affects awk, where POSIX standardized a new variable, CONVFMT, and new functions, toupper() and tolower(). The CONVFMT variable specifies the conversion format to use when converting numbers to strings (awk used to use OFMT for this purpose). The toupper() and tolower() functions each take a (presumably mixed case) string argument and return a new version of the string with all letters translated to the corresponding case.In addition, this edition covers GNU sed, newly available since the first edition. It also updates the first edition coverage of Bell Labs nawk and GNU awk (gawk), covers mawk, an additional freely available implementation of awk, and briefly discusses three commercial versions of awk, MKS awk, Thompson Automation awk (tawk), and Videosoft (VSAwk).</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">HTML has been on a wild ride. Sure, HTML started as a mere markup language, but more recently HTML’s put on some major muscle. Now we’ve got a language tuned for building web applications with Web storage, 2D drawing, offline support, sockets and threads, and more. And to speak this language you’ve got to go beyond HTML5 markup and into the world of the DOM, events, and JavaScript APIs. Now you probably already know all about HTML markup (otherwise known as structure) and you know all aboutCSS style (presentation), but what you’ve been missing is JavaScript (behavior). If all you know about are structure and presentation, you can create some great looking pages, but they’re still just pages. When you add behavior with JavaScript, you can create an interactive experience; even better, you can create full blown web applications.Head First HTML5 Programming is your ultimate tour guide to creating web applications with HTML5 and JavaScript, and we give you everything you need to know to build them, including: how to add interactivity to your pages, how to communicate with the world of Web services, and how to use the great new APIs being developed for HTML5. Here are just some of the things you’ll learn in Head First HTML5 Programing: Learn how to make your pages truly interactive by using the power of the DOM. Finally understand how JavaScript works and take yourself from novice to well-informed in just a few chapters. Learn how JavaScript APIs fit into the HTML5 ecosystem, and how to use any API in your web pages. Use the Geolocation API to know where your users are. Bring out your inner artist with Canvas, HTML5’s new 2D drawing surface. Go beyond just plugging a video into your pages, and create custom video experiences. Learn the secret to grabbing five megabytes of storage in every user’s browser. Improve your page’s responsiveness and performance with Web workers. And much more.</p>"
"<p class=\"description\">Building JavaScript Games teaches game programming through a series of engaging, arcade-style games that quickly expand your JavaScript and HTML5 skills. JavaScript is in the top ten most-used programming languages world wide, and is the basis for applications that can run in any modern browser, on any device from smart phone to tablet to PC. Especial emphasis is given to touch-based interface, but all games also run using a regular mouse and keyboard setup.The four games you’ll develop from reading this book are:Painter Jewel Jam Penguin Pairs Tick Tick These four games are casual, arcade-style games representing the aim-and-shoot, puzzle, maze, and platform styles of game play. The approach in Building JavaScript Games follows the basic structure of a game rather than the syntax of a language. From almost the very first chapter you are building games to run on your phone or other device and show to your friends. Successive projects teach about handling player input, manipulating game objects, designing game worlds, managing levels, and realism through physics. All told, you’ll develop four well-designed games, making Building JavaScript Games one of the most enjoyable ways there is to learn about programming browser-based games. The final chapters in the book contain a very nice bonus of sorts. In them you will find excerpts from interviews with two prominent people from the game industry: Mark Overmars, who is CTO of Tingly Games and creator of GameMaker, and Peter Vesterbacka, the CMO of Rovio Entertainment - the creators of the Angry Birds franchise. Their insight and perspective round off what is already a fun and valuable book.  What you’ll learn Create games to run on phones and tablets  Manage sprites and other game objects  React to player input through touch and button presses  Allow game players to progress through different levels  Achieve realistic movement through applied physics  Prepare your games properly for commercial deployment Who this book is for  Building JavaScript Games is for technology enthusiasts interested in learning about programming, and especially about game programming on their mobile devices.

"<div><p class=\"description\">EDITORIAL REVIEW:</p>\n<p class=\"description\">“The end was near.” —Voices from the Zombie WarThe Zombie War came unthinkably close to eradicating humanity. Max Brooks, driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic years, traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world, from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the undead, hell of that dreadful time. *World War Z* is the result. Never before have we had access to a document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror, and also the ineradicable spirit of resistance, that gripped human society through the plague years.Ranging from the now infamous village of New Dachang in the United Federation of China, where the epidemiological trail began with the twelve-year-old Patient Zero, to the unnamed northern forests where untold numbers sought a terrible and temporary refuge in the cold, to the United States of Southern Africa, where the Redeker Plan provided hope for humanity at an unspeakable price, to the west-of-the-Rockies redoubt where the North American tide finally started to turn, this invaluable chronicle reflects the full scope and duration of the Zombie War. Most of all, the book captures with haunting immediacy the human dimension of this epochal event. Facing the often raw and vivid nature of these personal accounts requires a degree of courage on the part of the reader, but the effort is invaluable because, as Mr. Brooks says in his introduction, “By excluding the human factor, aren’t we risking the kind of personal detachment from history that may, heaven forbid, lead us one day to repeat it? And in the end, isn’t the human factor the only true difference between us and the enemy we now refer to as ‘the living dead’?”Note: Some of the numerical and factual material contained in this edition was previously published under the auspices of the United Nations Postwar Commission.Eyewitness reports from the first truly global war“I found ‘Patient Zero’ behind the locked door of an abandoned apartment across town. . . . His wrists and feet were bound with plastic packing twine. Although he’d rubbed off the skin around his bonds, there was no blood. There was also no blood on his other wounds. . . . He was writhing like an animal; a gag muffled his growls. At first the villagers tried to hold me back. They warned me not to touch him, that he was ‘cursed.’ I shrugged them off and reached for my mask and gloves. The boy’s skin was . . . cold and gray . . . I could find neither his heartbeat nor his pulse.” —Dr. Kwang Jingshu, Greater Chongqing, United Federation of China“‘Shock and Awe’? Perfect name. . . . But what if the enemy can’t be shocked and awed? Not just won’t, but biologically can’t! That’s what happened that day outside New York City, that’s the failure that almost lost us the whole damn war. The fact that we couldn’t shock and awe Zack boomeranged right back in our faces and actually allowed Zack to shock and awe us! They’re not afraid! No matter what we do, no matter how many we kill, they will never, ever be afraid!” —Todd Wainio, former U.S. Army infantryman and veteran of the Battle of Yonkers“Two hundred million zombies. Who can even visualize that type of number, let alone combat it? . . . For the first time in history, we faced an enemy that was actively waging total war. They had no limits of endurance. They would never negotiate, never surrender. They would fight until the very end because, unlike us, every single one of them, every second of every day, was devoted to consuming all life on Earth.” —General Travis D’Ambrosia, Supreme Allied Commander, Europe*From the Hardcover edition.*</p></div>"

It features a significant amount of vital chemical shift and coupling information but more importantly, it presents sound principles for the selection of the techniques relevant to the solving of particular types of problem, whilst stressing the importance of extracting the maximum available information from the simple 1-D proton experiment and of using this to plan subsequent experiments. Proton NMR is covered in detail, with a description of the fundamentals of the technique, the instrumentation and the data that it provides before going on to discuss optimal solvent selection and sample preparation. This is followed by a detailed study of each of the important classes of protons, breaking the spectrum up into regions (exchangeables, aromatics, heterocyclics, alkenes etc.). This is followed by consideration of the phenomena that we know can leave chemists struggling; chiral centres, restricted rotation, anisotropy, accidental equivalence, non-first-order spectra etc. Having explained the potential pitfalls that await the unwary, the book then goes on to devote chapters to the chemical techniques and the most useful instrumental ones that can be employed to combat them. A discussion is then presented on carbon-13 NMR, detailing its pros and cons and showing how it can be used in conjunction with proton NMR via the pivotal 2-D techniques (HSQC and HMBC) to yield vital structural information. Some of the more specialist techniques available are then discussed, i.e. flow NMR, solvent suppression, Magic Angle Spinning, etc. Other important nuclei are then discussed and useful data supplied. This is followed by a discussion of the neglected use of NMR as a tool for quantification and new techniques for this explained. The book then considers the safety aspects of NMR spectroscopy, reviewing NMR software for spectral prediction and data handling and concludes with a set of worked Q&amp;As.</p>"

"<div><p><strong>NATIONAL BESTSELLER, PULITZER PRIZE WINNER, National Book Critic's Circle Award Finalist, A <em>New York Times</em> Notable Book, One of the Best Books of the Year<br></strong><strong>*The Boston Globe, The Christian Science Monitor, The Denver Post, The Kansas City Star, Los Angeles Times, New York, People, Rocky Mountain News, Time, The Village Voice, The Washington Post</strong>*</p><p>The searing, postapocalyptic novel destined to become Cormac McCarthy's masterpiece. A father and his son walk alone through burned America. Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind. It is cold enough to crack stones, and when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the coast, although they don't know what, if anything, awaits them there. They have nothing; just a pistol to defend themselves against the lawless bands that stalk the road, the clothes they are wearing, a cart of scavenged food-—and each other.<strong>The Road </strong>is the profoundly moving story of a journey. It boldly imagines a future in which no hope remains, but in which the father and his son, \"each the other's world entire,\" are sustained by love. Awesome in the totality of its vision, it is an unflinching meditation on the worst and the best that we are capable of: ultimate destructiveness, desperate tenacity, and the tenderness that keeps two people alive in the face of total devastation.</p><h3>Amazon.com Review</h3><p>Best known for his Border Trilogy, hailed in the San Francisco Chronicle as \"an American classic to stand with the finest literary achievements of the century,\" Cormac McCarthy has written ten rich and often brutal novels, including the bestselling <em>No Country for Old Men</em>, and <em>The Road</em>. Profoundly dark, told in spare, searing prose, <em>The Road</em> is a post-apocalyptic masterpiece, one of the best books we've read this year, but in case you need a second (and expert) opinion, we asked Dennis Lehane, author of equally rich, occasionally bleak and brutal novels, to read it and give us his take. Read his glowing review below. <em>--Daphne Durham</em><br></p><hr><p><strong>Guest Reviewer: Dennis Lehane</strong><br></p><p><strong>Dennis Lehane, master of the hard-boiled thriller, generated a cult following with his series about private investigators Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro, wowed readers with the intense and gut-wrenching <em>Mystic River</em>, blew fans all away with the mind-bending <em>Shutter Island</em>, and switches gears with <em>Coronado</em>, his new collection of gritty short stories (and one play). </strong> <br></p><p>Cormac McCarthy sets his new novel, <em>The Road</em>, in a post-apocalyptic blight of gray skies that drizzle ash, a world in which all matter of wildlife is extinct, starvation is not only prevalent but nearly all-encompassing, and marauding bands of cannibals roam the environment with pieces of human flesh stuck between their teeth. If this sounds oppressive and dispiriting, it is. McCarthy may have just set to paper the definitive vision of the world after nuclear war, and in this recent age of relentless saber-rattling by the global powers, it's not much of a leap to feel his vision could be not far off the mark nor, sadly, right around the corner. Stealing across this horrific (and that's the only word for it) landscape are an unnamed man and his emaciated son, a boy probably around the age of ten. It is the love the father feels for his son, a love as deep and acute as his grief, that could surprise readers of McCarthy's previous work. McCarthy's Gnostic impressions of mankind have left very little place for love. In fact that greatest love affair in any of his novels, I would argue, occurs between the Billy Parham and the wolf in <em>The Crossing</em>. But here the love of a desperate father for his sickly son transcends all else. McCarthy has always written about the battle between light and darkness; the darkness usually comprises 99.9% of the world, while any illumination is the weak shaft thrown by a penlight running low on batteries. In <em>The Road</em>, those batteries are almost out--the entire world is, quite literally, dying--so the final affirmation of hope in the novel's closing pages is all the more shocking and maybe all the more enduring as the boy takes all of his father's (and McCarthy's) rage at the hopeless folly of man and lays it down, lifting up, in its place, the oddest of all things: faith. <em>--Dennis Lehane</em><br></p><hr><h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3><p>McCarthy's latest novel, a frightening apocalyptic vision, is narrated by a nameless man, one of the few survivors of an unspecified civilization-ending catastrophe. He and his young son are trekking along a treacherous highway, starving and freezing, trying to avoid roving cannibal armies. The tale, and their lives, are saved from teetering over the edge of bleakness thanks to the man's fierce belief that they are \"the good guys\" who are preserving the light of humanity. In this stark, effective production, Stechschulte gives the father an appropriately harsh, weary voice that sways little from its numbed register except to urge on the weakening boy or soothe his fears after an encounter with barbarians. When they uncover some vestige of the former world, the man recalls its vanished wonder with an aching nostalgia that makes the listener's heart swell. Stechschulte portrays the son with a mournful, slightly breathy tone that emphasizes the child's whininess, making him much less sympathetic than his resourceful father. With no music or effects interrupting Stechschulte's carefully measured pace and gruff, straightforward delivery, McCarthy's darkly poetic prose comes alive in a way that will transfix listeners. <br>Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind. It is cold enough to crack stones, and when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the coast, although they don’t know what, if anything, awaits them there. They have nothing; just a pistol to defend themselves against the lawless bands that stalk the road, the clothes they are wearing, a cart of scavenged food—and each other.The Road is the profoundly moving story of a journey. It boldly imagines a future in which no hope remains, but in which the father and his son, “each the other’s world entire,” are sustained by love. Awesome in the totality of its vision, it is an unflinching meditation on the worst and the best that we are capable of: ultimate destructiveness, desperate tenacity, and the tenderness that keeps two people alive in the face of total devastation."
"<div><p>This book is for anyone who wants to support computer peripherals under the Linux operating system or who wants to develop new hardware and run it under Linux. Linux is the fastest-growing segment of the Unix market, is winning over enthusiastic adherents in many application areas, and is being viewed more and more as a good platform for embedded systems. \"Linux Device Drivers, \" already a classic in its second edition, reveals information that heretofore has been shared by word of mouth or in cryptic source code comments, on how to write drivers for a wide range of devices.  </p><p>Version 2.4 of the Linux kernel includes significant changes to device drivers, simplifying many activities, but providing subtle new features that can make a driver both more efficient and more flexible. The second edition of this book thoroughly covers these changes, as well as new processors and buses.  </p><p>You don't have to be a kernel hacker to understand and enjoy this book; all you need is an understanding of C and some background in Unix system calls. You'll learn how to write drivers for character devices, block devices, and network interfaces, guided by full-featured examples that you can compile and run without special hardware. Major changes in the second edition include discussions of symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) and locking, new CPUs, and recently supported buses. For those who are curious about how an operating system does its job, this book provides insights into address spaces, asynchronous events, and I/O.  </p><p>Portability is a major concern in the text. The book is centered on version 2.4, but includes information for kernels back to 2.0 where feasible. \"Linux Device Driver\" also shows how to maximize portability among hardware platforms; examples were tested on IA32 (PC) and IA64, PowerPC, SPARC and SPARC64, Alpha, ARM, and MIPS.  </p><p>Contents include: Building a driver and loading modulesComplete character, block, and network driversDebugging a driverTimingHandling symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) systemsMemory management and DMAInterruptsPortability issuesPeripheral Component Interconnect (PCI)</p></div>"
"<p>This is the second edition of the popular textbook on representation theory of finite groups. The authors have revised the text greatly and included new chapters on Characters of GL(2, q) and Permutations and Characters. The theory is developed in terms of modules, since this is appropriate for more advanced work, but considerable emphasis is placed upon constructing characters. The character tables of many groups are given, including all groups of order less than 32, and all but one of the simple groups of order less than 1000. Each chapter is accompanied by a variety of exercises, and full solutions to all the exercises are provided at the end of the book</p>"
"<p><strong>The author of <em>Zero</em> explains the scientific revolution that is transforming the way we understand our world</strong> Previously the domain of philosophers and linguists, information theory has now moved beyond the province of code breakers to become the crucial science of our time. In <em>Decoding the Universe</em>, Charles Seife draws on his gift for making cutting-edge science accessible to explain how this new tool is deciphering everything from the purpose of our DNA to the parallel universes of our Byzantine cosmos. The result is an exhilarating adventure that deftly combines cryptology, physics, biology, and mathematics to cast light on the new understanding of the laws that govern life and the universe.  </p>"
"<p>This first volume, a three-part introduction to the subject, is intended for students with a beginning knowledge of mathematical analysis who are motivated to discover the ideas that shape Fourier analysis. It begins with the simple conviction that Fourier arrived at in the early nineteenth century when studying problems in the physical sciences--that an arbitrary function can be written as an infinite sum of the most basic trigonometric functions.<br>The first part implements this idea in terms of notions of convergence and summability of Fourier series, while highlighting applications such as the isoperimetric inequality and equidistribution. The second part deals with the Fourier transform and its applications to classical partial differential equations and the Radon transform; a clear introduction to the subject serves to avoid technical difficulties. The book closes with Fourier theory for finite abelian groups, which is applied to prime numbers in arithmetic progression.<br>In organizing their exposition, the authors have carefully balanced an emphasis on key conceptual insights against the need to provide the technical underpinnings of rigorous analysis. Students of mathematics, physics, engineering and other sciences will find the theory and applications covered in this volume to be of real interest. <br>The Princeton Lectures in Analysis represents a sustained effort to introduce the core areas of mathematical analysis while also illustrating the organic unity between them. Numerous examples and applications throughout its four planned volumes, of which \"Fourier Analysis\" is the first, highlight the far-reaching consequences of certain ideas in analysis to other fields of mathematics and a variety of sciences. Stein and Shakarchi move from an introduction addressing Fourier series and integrals to in-depth considerations of complex analysis; measure and integration theory, and Hilbert spaces; and, finally, further topics such as functional analysis, distributions and elements of probability theory.  </p>"
"<p>An unprecedented wealth of data is being generated by genome sequencing projects and other experimental efforts to determine the structure and function of biological molecules. The demands and opportunities for interpreting these data are expanding rapidly. Bioinformatics is the development and application of computer methods for management, analysis, interpretation, and prediction, as well as for the design of experiments. Machine learning approaches (e.g., neural networks, hidden Markov models, and belief networks) are ideally suited for areas where there is a lot of data but little theory, which is the situation in molecular biology. The goal in machine learning is to extract useful information from a body of data by building good probabilistic models--and to automate the process as much as possible.In this book Pierre Baldi and S ren Brunak present the key machine learning approaches and apply them to the computational problems encountered in the analysis of biological data. The book is aimed both at biologists and biochemists who need to understand new data-driven algorithms and at those with a primary background in physics, mathematics, statistics, or computer science who need to know more about applications in molecular biology.This new second edition contains expanded coverage of probabilistic graphical models and of the applications of neural networks, as well as a new chapter on microarrays and gene expression.

"<p class=\"description\">Ever since Copernicus, scientists have continually adjusted their view of human nature, moving it further and further from its ancient position at the center of Creation. But in recent years, a startling new concept has evolved that places it more firmly than ever in a special position. Known as the Anthropic Cosmological Principle, this collection of ideas holds that the existence of intelligent observers determines the fundamental structure of the Universe. In its most radical version, the Anthropic Principle asserts that \"intelligent information-processing must come into existence in the Universe, and once it comes into existence, it will never die out.\" This wide-ranging and detailed book explores the many ramifications of the Anthropic Cosmological Principle, covering the whole spectrum of human inquiry from Aristotle to Z bosons. Bringing a unique combination of skills and knowledge to the subject, John D. Barrow and Frank J. Tipler--two of the world's leading cosmologists--cover the definition and nature of life, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, and the interpretation of the quantum theory in relation to the existence of observers. The book will be of vital interest to philosophers, theologians, mathematicians, scientists, and historians, as well as to anyone concerned with the connection between the vastness of the universe of stars and galaxies and the existence of life within it on a small planet out in the suburbs of the Milky Way.</p>"
"<p>Describing many of the most important aspects of Lie group theory, this book presents the subject in a 'hands on' way. Rather than concentrating on theorems and proofs, the book shows the applications of the material to physical sciences and applied mathematics. Many examples of Lie groups and Lie algebras are given throughout the text. The relation between Lie group theory and algorithms for solving ordinary differential equations is presented and shown to be analogous to the relation between Galois groups and algorithms for solving polynomial equations. Other chapters are devoted to differential geometry, relativity, electrodynamics, and the hydrogen atom. Problems are given at the end of each chapter so readers can monitor their understanding of the materials. This is a fascinating introduction to Lie groups for graduate and undergraduate students in physics, mathematics and electrical engineering, as well as researchers in these fields.</p>"

"<div><p class=\"description\">SUMMARY:<br>Jonas's world is perfect. Everything is under control. There is no war or fear of pain. There are no choices. Every person is assigned a role in the community. When Jonas turns 12 he is singled out to receive special training from The Giver. The Giver alone holds the memories of the true pain and pleasure of life. Now, it is time for Jonas to receive the truth. There is no turning back. \"From the Paperback edition.</p><p class=\"description\"></p><div><h3>Amazon.com Review</h3><p class=\"description\">In a world with no poverty, no crime, no sickness and no unemployment, and where every family is happy, 12-year-old Jonas is chosen to be the community's Receiver of Memories. Under the tutelage of the Elders and an old man known as the Giver, he discovers the disturbing truth about his utopian world and struggles against the weight of its hypocrisy. With echoes of <em>Brave New World</em>, in this 1994 Newbery Medal winner, Lowry examines the idea that people might freely choose to give up their humanity in order to create a more stable society. Gradually Jonas learns just how costly this ordered and pain-free society can be, and boldly decides he cannot pay the price. </p><h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3><p class=\"description\">In the \"ideal\" world into which Jonas was born, everybody has sensibly agreed that well-matched married couples will raise exactly two offspring, one boy and one girl. These children's adolescent sexual impulses will be stifled with specially prescribed drugs; at age 12 they will receive an appropriate career assignment, sensibly chosen by the community's Elders. This is a world in which the old live in group homes and are \"released\"—to great celebration—at the proper time; the few infants who do not develop according to schedule are also \"released,\" but with no fanfare. Lowry's development of this civilization is so deft that her readers, like the community's citizens, will be easily seduced by the chimera of this ordered, pain-free society. Until the time that Jonah begins training for his job assignment—the rigorous and prestigious position of Receiver of Memory—he, too, is a complacent model citizen. But as his near-mystical training progresses, and he is weighed down and enriched with society's collective memories of a world as stimulating as it was flawed, Jonas grows increasingly aware of the hypocrisy that rules his world. With a storyline that hints at Christian allegory and an eerie futuristic setting, this intriguing novel calls to mind John Christopher's Tripods trilogy and Hans Christian Andersen's The Little Match Girl. Lowry is once again in top form—raising many questions while answering few, and unwinding a tale fit for the most adventurous readers.

It is set in a society which is at first presented as a utopian society and gradually appears more and more dystopian. The novel follows a boy named Jonas through the twelfth year of his life. The society has eliminated pain and strife by converting to \"Sameness,\" a plan that has also eradicated emotional depth from their lives. Jonas is selected to inherit the position of \"Receiver of Memory,\" the person who stores all the past memories of the time before Sameness, in case they are ever needed to aid in decisions that others lack the experience to make. When Jonas meets the previous receiver-The \"Giver\"-he is confused in many ways. The Giver is also able to break some rules, such as turning off the speaker and lying to people of the community. As Jonas receives the memories from the Giver, he discovers the power of knowledge. The people in his community are happy because they don't know of a better life, but the knowledge of what they are missing out on could create major chaos. He faces a dilemma: Should he stay with the community, his family living a shallow life without love, color, choices, and knowledge, or should he run away to where he can live a full life? ~~~ Lois Lowry (born Lois Ann Hammersberg[1] on March 20, 1937) is an American author of children's literature. She began her career as a photographer and a freelance journalist during the early 1970s. Her work as a journalist drew the attention of Houghton Mifflin and they encouraged her to write her first children's book, A Summer to Die, which was published in 1977 (when Lowry was 40 years old). She has since written more than 30 books for children and published an autobiography. Two of her works have been awarded the prestigious Newbery Medal: Number the Stars in 1990, and The Giver in 1993. ~~~ As an author, Lowry is known for writing about difficult subject matters within her works for children.</p></div>"

"<p class=\"description\">Two important subproblems of computer vision are the detection and recognition of 2D objects in gray-level images. This book discusses the construction and training of models, computational approaches to efficient implementation, and parallel implementations in biologically plausible neural network architectures. The approach is based on statistical modeling and estimation, with an emphasis on simplicity, transparency, and computational efficiency.The book describes a range of deformable template models, from coarse sparse models involving discrete, fast computations to more finely detailed models based on continuum formulations, involving intensive optimization. Each model is defined in terms of a subset of points on a reference grid (the template), a set of admissible instantiations of these points (deformations), and a statistical model for the data given a particular instantiation of the object present in the image. A recurring theme is a coarse to fine approach to the solution of vision problems. The book provides detailed descriptions of the algorithms used as well as the code, and the software and data sets are available on the Web.</p>"
"<p>The standard cosmological picture of our Universe emerging from a 'big bang' leaves open many fundamental questions which string theory, a unified theory of all forces of nature, should be able to answer. This 2007 text was the first dedicated to string cosmology, and contains a pedagogical introduction to the basic notions of the subject. It describes the possible scenarios suggested by string theory for the primordial evolution of our Universe. It discusses the main phenomenological consequences of these scenarios, stresses their differences from each other, and compares them to the more conventional models of inflation. The book summarises over 15 years of research in this field and introduces advances. It is self-contained, so it can be read by astrophysicists with no knowledge of string theory, and high-energy physicists with little understanding of cosmology. Detailed and explicit derivations of all the results presented provide a deeper appreciation of the subject.</p>"

"<div><p>Famous the world over for the creative brilliance of his insights into the physical world, Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman also possessed an extraordinary talent for explaining difficult concepts to the nonscientist. QED--the edited version of four lectures on quantum electrodynamics that Feynman gave to the general public at UCLA as part of the Alix G. Mautner Memorial Lecture series--is perhaps the best example of his ability to communicate both the substance and the spirit of science to the layperson.  </p><p>The focus, as the title suggests, is quantum electrodynamics (QED), the part of the quantum theory of fields that describes the interactions of the quanta of the electromagnetic field-light, X rays, gamma rays--with matter and those of charged particles with one another. By extending the formalism developed by Dirac in 1933, which related quantum and classical descriptions of the motion of particles, Feynman revolutionized the quantum mechanical understanding of the nature of particles and waves. And, by incorporating his own readily visualizable formulation of quantum mechanics, Feynman created a diagrammatic version of QED that made calculations much simpler and also provided visual insights into the mechanisms of quantum electrodynamic processes.  </p><p>In this book, using everyday language, spatial concepts, visualizations, and his renowned \"Feynman diagrams\" instead of advanced mathematics, Feynman successfully provides a definitive introduction to QED for a lay readership without any distortion of the basic science. Characterized by Feynman's famously original clarity and humor, this popular book on QED has not been equaled since its publication.</p></div>"

In this eye-opening tour of the frontiers of biology, where scientists are expanding our understanding of life as we know it, we learn that some treatments for the common cold do more harm than good; that the world’s oceans are home to an astonishing number of viruses; and that the evolution of HIV is now in overdrive, spawning more mutated strains than we care to imagine.  </p><p>The <em>New York Times Book Review</em> calls Carl Zimmer “as fine a science essayist as we have.” <em>A Planet of Viruses</em> is sure to please his many fans and further enhance his reputation as one of America’s most respected and admired science journalists.</p></div>"
"<div><h3>Review</h3><p><em>Nine Algorithms That Changed the Future</em> offers a great way to find out what computer science is really about. In this very readable book, MacCormick (a computer scientist at Dickinson College) shows how a collection of sets of intangible instructions invented since the 1940s has led to monumental changes in all our lives. . . . MacCormick provides a taste of why we computer scientists get so excited about algorithms--for their utility, of course, but also for their beauty and elegance. (Paul Curzon <em>Science</em> )<br></p><p>Most people know little and care less about how, say, electronic payments are kept secure or how movies are crammed onto DVDs. But as MacCormick shows, they're the result of often stunning ingenuity and creativity. . . . For insights into the thinking that can turn gigabytes into gigabucks, start here. (Robert Matthews <em>BBC Focus</em> )<br></p><p>[MacCormick] masterfully uses everyday analogies in a way that gets to the heart of the ideas (he calls them tricks) that make the algorithms work. While this is essential for readers without mathematical background, the other lesson that jumps out is that this is a great way to introduce these algorithms to mathematics and computer science students who will go on to more in-depth treatments. . . . This excellent survey is an outstanding achievement and would make an excellent library acquisition. (Art Gittleman <em>MAA Reviews</em> )<br></p><p>MacCormick leaves the reader with a sense of the engine that powers the networked world. And at its best, <em>Nine Algorithms</em> enables you to recognise the real world and begin to see those algorithms alive and kicking all around us. (Kevin Slavin <em>New Scientist</em> )<br></p><p>Excellent. . . . MacCormick clearly believes that to be a responsible driver of current technology, you need to understand what is going on at the fundamental level. In addition, he wants us to take delight in the elegance of the solutions that have been developed to address complex questions of the security, integrity and availability of data and digital services. . . . This is an unusually well-written text suitable for anyone with an interest in how today's information systems really work. (John Gilbey <em>Times Higher Education</em> )<br></p><p><em>Nine Algorithms That Changed the Future</em> is technically right on the money, but manages to explain things in ways that are both understandable and fun. . . . Each chapter starts out very simply, gradually building up more complex examples until you reach a full understanding of the algorithm being explained. . . . The writing is excellent: clear, precise, and fun. I highly recommend this book to anyone curious about the ingenious mathematical and algorithmic ideas underlying some of today's most ubiquitous technology. (Brent Yorgey <em>Math Less Traveled</em> )<br></p><p>MacCormick's book is an easy-to-read and enjoyable guide to some key algorithms. Above all, it conveys a sense of wonder--at the beautiful science, rather than the technical feats, that makes computers do their magic. (Andreas Trabesinger <em>Nature Physics</em> )<br></p><p>Despite the widespread popular interest in computers, there are very few good, popular introductions to the central ideas of computer science. <em>Nine Algorithms that Changed the Future</em> is certainly one of the best that I have seen. . . . An extraordinary achievement in the daunting task of presenting computer science for a popular audience. (Ernest Davis <em>SIAM News</em> )<br></p><p>One of the best things about <em>Nine Algorithms That Changed the Future</em> is that it is of interest to computer professionals and innocent bystanders (non-professionals) alike. The author doesn't attempt to 'baffle us with science' or blow us away with his mathematical prowess. Instead, he employs simple analogies that we can all understand. His use of mixing colored paints to explain the machinations of public key cryptography is, frankly, brilliant. . . . I highly recommend this book as a very enjoyable read that will be of interest to anyone who would like to understand more about the way in which the computer systems we use every day perform their magic. (Clive Maxfield <em>EE Times</em> )<br></p><p>In our increasingly digitally dominated world, any book that attempts to explain for the layperson 'the ingenious ideas that drive today's computers' should find a ready audience and become required reading for the curious, enthusiastic, responsible and attentive netizen. . . . [<em>Nine Algorithms That Changed the Future</em>] does indeed go a long way toward satisfying that need. . . . MacCormick's two main techniques for conveying his insights are metaphor and a stepwise progression of complexity, moving from usefully oversimplified examples to the actual algorithmic realities. . . . A real sense of the steady progression of computer science arises. (Paul Di Filippo <em>Barnes and Noble Review</em> )<br></p><p>Unusual and engaging. . . . A clear and simple explanation of what it is that makes everyday business and personal computing work. . . . MacCormick has a knack of explaining the smart tricks behind how search engines work and why Google is the best; the cryptography that makes online payments safe (with a brilliant paint-mixing analogy for public keys); error correction of noisy signals; pattern recognition from handwritten postcodes to people's faces (his specialism); data compression in 'zip' files; database structures and certified digital signatures. . . . I raced through it and eagerly want to know more. (Diana Hunter <em>Financial World</em> )<br></p><p>Algorithms are the controls that drive the engines of the Internet age. Here, MacCormick provides a popular account of several algorithms that affect people's everyday lives. (<em>Choice</em> )<br></p><p>John MacCormick's <em>Nine Algorithms that Changed the Future</em> joins a small set of books that have tried to communicate the nature of the field for a general audience. MacCormick provides something like a quick package tour, with stops at a few highlights--the 'great algorithms' of the title. . . . MacCormick has provided a nice introductory tour, suitable for those who are willing to commit to only a brief visit. Perhaps the taste that he provides will inspire some of those tourists to a more extensive exploration. (Cary Gray <em>Books &amp; Culture</em> ) </p><h3>From the Inside Flap</h3><p>\"It's been a long time since any book has given me the excitement I remember from reading Hawking and Feynman in my teens. This book does exactly that. It reminds me why I love computer science. MacCormick's explanations are easy to understand yet they tell the real story of how these algorithms actually work. This is a book that deserves not just to be admired, but celebrated.\"--Andrew Fitzgibbon, creator of Emmy-winning camera software and consultant for the Xbox 360 Kinect</p><p>\"This book is for those who have wondered, 'What actually goes on in my computer?' MacCormick clearly explains some of the algorithms used by hundreds of millions of people daily. Not the simple algorithms like arithmetic and sorting, but more complex things such as how to determine the importance of web pages, if and when we are justified in trusting a computer-mediated conversation with another person, and the puzzling issue of what cannot be computed. I recommend it highly.\"--Chuck Thacker, winner of the 2010 Turing Award</p><p>\"This is a delightful exploration, in layman's terms, of nine beautiful algorithms that are essential to today's computers. Using clever analogies, MacCormick gives readers a greater knowledge of both the technology they use every day and the intellectual underpinnings of computing. He combines a mathematician's appreciation of powerful ideas and an educator's skill at explaining them in an engaging way.\"--Sharon Perl, Google</p><p>\"MacCormick picks nine algorithms for his version of 'genius awards,' and they are good ones. The reader comes away with a new sense of what genius in computer science looks like. And MacCormick leaves room for a future genius, perhaps inspired by this book, to someday make it a top ten list.\"--William H. Press, coauthor of <em>Numerical Recipes</em></p><p>\"John MacCormick has taken many of the algorithms that we rely on every day and explained them in a way that you can understand even if you have a meager mathematical background. I particularly like how he explains public-key cryptography by analogy to mixing paint.\"--Thomas H. Cormen, Dartmouth College</p><p>\"MacCormick does a great job of explaining sophisticated ideas in a simple way, and his analogies are wonderful.

"<p class=\"description\">For decades, proponents of artificial intelligence have argued that computers will soon be doing everything that a human mind can do. Admittedly, computers now play chess at the grandmaster level, but do they understand the game as we do? Can a computer eventually do everything a human mind can do? In this absorbing and frequently contentious book, Roger Penrose--eminent physicist and winner, with Stephen Hawking, of the prestigious Wolf prize--puts forward his view that there are some facets of human thinking that can never be emulated by a machine. Penrose examines what physics and mathematics can tell us about how the mind works, what they can't, and what we need to know to understand the physical processes of consciousness. He is among a growing number of physicists who think Einstein wasn't being stubborn when he said his \"little finger\" told him that quantum mechanics is incomplete, and he concludes that laws even deeper than quantum mechanics are essential for the operation of a mind. To support this contention, Penrose takes the reader on a dazzling tour that covers such topics as complex numbers, Turing machines, complexity theory, quantum mechanics, formal systems, Godel undecidability, phase spaces, Hilbert spaces, black holes, white holes, Hawking radiation, entropy, quasicrystals, the structure of the brain, and scores of other subjects. The Emperor's New Mind will appeal to anyone with a serious interest in modern physics and its relation to philosophical issues, as well as to physicists, mathematicians, philosophers and those on either side of the AI debate.</p>"

"SUMMARY: Winner of the 1961 Hugo Award for Best Novel and widely considered one of the most accomplished, powerful, and enduring classics of modern speculative fiction, Walter M. Miller, Jr.'s A Canticle for Leibowitz is a true landmark of twentieth-century literature -- a chilling and still-provocative look at a post-apocalyptic future. In a nightmarish ruined world slowly awakening to the light after sleeping in darkness, the infant rediscoveries of science are secretly nourished by cloistered monks dedicated to the study and preservation of the relics and writings of the blessed Saint Isaac Leibowitz. From here the story spans centuries of ignorance, violence, and barbarism, viewing through a sharp, satirical eye the relentless progression of a human race damned by its inherent humanness to recelebrate its grand foibles and repeat its grievous mistakes. Seriously funny, stunning, and tragic, eternally fresh, imaginative, and altogether remarkable, A Canticle for Leibowitz retains its ability to enthrall and amaze. It is now, as it always has been, a masterpiece."
"<p>On Friday, May 11, 2001, the world mourned the untimely passing of Douglas Adams, beloved creator of \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,\" dead of a heart attack at age forty-nine. Thankfully, in addition to a magnificent literary legacy--which includes seven novels and three co-authored works of nonfiction--Douglas left us something more. The book you are about to enjoy was rescued from his four computers, culled from an archive of chapters from his long-awaited novel-in-progress, as well as his short stories, speeches, articles, interviews, and letters. <br>In a way that none of his previous books could, \"The Salmon of Doubt\" provides the full, dazzling, laugh-out-loud experience of a journey through the galaxy as perceived by Douglas Adams. From a boy's first love letter (to his favorite science fiction magazine) to the distinction of possessing a nose of heroic proportions; from climbing Kilimanjaro in a rhino costume to explaining why Americans can't make a decent cup of tea; from lyrical tributes to the sublime pleasures found in music by Procol Harum, the Beatles, and Bach to the follies of his hopeless infatuation with technology; from fantastic, fictional forays into the private life of Genghis Khan to extended visits with Dirk Gently and Zaphod Beeblebrox: this is the vista from the elevated perch of one of the tallest, funniest, most brilliant, and most penetrating social critics and thinkers of our time. <br>Welcome to the wonderful mind of Douglas Adams. \"From the Hardcover edition.\"</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">It's very easy to get a little disheartened when your planet has been blown up, the woman you love has vanished in a misunderstanding about the nature of space-time, the spaceship you are on crashes in flames on a remote and Bob-fearing planet and all you have to fall back on are a few simple sandwich-making skills. However, instead of being disheartened, Arthur Dent makes the terrible mistake of starting to enjoy life a bit and, immediately, all hell breaks loose. Hell takes a number of forms: there is the usual Ford Prefect form of hell, fresh hell in the form of an all-new version of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy which behaves in an altogether more mysterious, sinister and airborn manner, and a totally unexpected hell that arrives in the form of a teenage girl who utterly startles Arthur Dent by being his daughter when he didn't even know he had one. Much as Arthur would love to stay in his rural sandwich-making idyll, he is forced to set off on his travels once again, this time on the back of a mysterious Perfectly Normal Beast. Can he save the Earth from total destruction throughout all dimensional probabilities? Can he save the Guide from a hostile alien takeover? Can he save the Grebulons from completely myopic junked-up idiocy? Can he save his daughter Random from herself? Of course not. He never even works out what is going on, exactly. Will you?

"<div><p><strong>#1 <em>NEW YORK TIMES</em> BESTSELLER</strong><br></p><p>When and how did the universe begin? Why are we here? What is the nature of reality? Is the apparent “grand design” of our universe evidence of a benevolent creator who set things in motion—or does science offer another explanation? In this startling and lavishly illustrated book, Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow present the most recent scientific thinking about these and other abiding mysteries of the universe, in nontechnical language marked by brilliance and simplicity. <br></p><p>According to quantum theory, the cosmos does not have just a single existence or history. The authors explain that we ourselves are the product of quantum fluctuations in the early universe, and show how quantum theory predicts the “multiverse”—the idea that ours is just one of many universes that appeared spontaneously out of nothing, each with different laws of nature. They conclude with a riveting assessment of M-theory, an explanation of the laws governing our universe that is currently the <em>only</em> viable candidate for a “theory of everything”: the unified theory that Einstein was looking for, which, if confirmed, would represent the ultimate triumph of human reason.</p><h3>Amazon.com Review</h3><p><strong>Stephen Hawking on *The Grand Design</strong>*</p><p>How can we understand the world in which we find ourselves? Over twenty years ago I wrote <em>A Brief History of Time</em>, to try to explain where the universe came from, and where it is going. But that book left some important questions unanswered. Why is there a universe--why is there something rather than nothing? Why do we exist? Why are the laws of nature what they are? Did the universe need a designer and creator?</p><p>It was Einstein’s dream to discover the grand design of the universe, a single theory that explains everything. However, physicists in Einstein’s day hadn’t made enough progress in understanding the forces of nature for that to be a realistic goal. And by the time I had begun writing <em>A Brief History of Time</em>, there were still several key advances that had not yet been made that would prevent us from fulfilling Einstein’s dream. But in recent years the development of M-theory, the top-down approach to cosmology, and new observations such as those made by satellites like NASA’s COBE and WMAP, have brought us closer than ever to that single theory, and to being able to answer those deepest of questions. And so Leonard Mlodinow and I set out to write a sequel to <em>A Brief History of Time</em> to attempt to answer the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything. The result is <em>The Grand Design</em>, the product of our four-year effort.</p><p>In <em>The Grand Design</em> we explain why, according to quantum theory, the cosmos does not have just a single existence, or history, but rather that every possible history of the universe exists simultaneously. We question the conventional concept of reality, posing instead a \"model-dependent\" theory of reality. We discuss how the laws of our particular universe are extraordinarily finely tuned so as to allow for our existence, and show why quantum theory predicts the multiverse--the idea that ours is just one of many universes that appeared spontaneously out of nothing, each with different laws of nature. And we assess M-Theory, an explanation of the laws governing the multiverse, and the <em>only</em> viable candidate for a complete \"theory of everything.\" As we promise in our opening chapter, unlike the answer to the Ultimate Question of Life given in the <em>Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</em>, the answer we provide in <em>The Grand Design</em> is not, simply, \"42.\"</p><p>(Photo © Philip Waterson, LBIPP, LRPS)</p><hr><h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Hawking, the renowned Cambridge mathematician, teams up with Mlodinow, a physicist at Caltech, for a brief introduction to \"the grand design\" of the universe. If this project seems ambitious for a four and a half–hour audio production, it is; however, even general readers will be able to follow along as the authors guide us through M-theories, quantum mechanics, general and special relativity, and other mind-blowing cosmological discoveries of the last century. The goal of all these journeys through the history of science is to answer some basic questions: why is there a universe in the first place? What other universes may in fact be possible, given Richard Feynman's theory of multiple histories? The audio version of this book is simple and scaled down.

"<p class=\"description\">This book presents a full spectrum of views on current approaches to modeling cell mechanics. The authors of this book come from the biophysics, bioengineering, and physical chemistry communities and each joins the discussion with a unique perspective on biological systems. Consequently, the approaches range from finite element methods commonly used in continuum mechanics to models of the cytoskeleton as a cross-linked polymer network to models of glassy materials and gels. Studies reflect both the static, instantaneous nature of the structure, as well as its dynamic nature due to polymerization and the full array of biological processes. While it is unlikely that a single unifying approach will evolve from this diversity, it is our hope that a better appreciation of the various perspectives will lead to a highly coordinated approach to exploring the essential problems and better discussions among investigators with differing views.</p>"
"<p>Can one learn linear algebra solely by solving problems? Paul Halmos thinks so, and you will too once you read this book. The Linear Algebra Problem Book is an ideal text for a course in linear algebra. It takes the student step by step from the basic axioms of a field through the notion of vector spaces, on to advanced concepts such as inner product spaces and normality. All of this occurs by way of a series of 164 problems, each with hints and, at the back of the book, full solutions. This book is a marvelous example of how to teach and learn mathematics by 'doing' mathematics. It will work well for classes taught in small groups and can also be used for self-study. After working their way through the book, students will understand not only the theorems of linear algebra, but also some of the questions which were asked which enabled the theorems to be discovered in the first place. They will gain confidence in their problem solving abilities and be better prepared to understand more advanced courses. As the author explains, 'I don't think I understand a subject until I know the questions I wrote this book to organize those questions, problems, in my own mind.' Try this book with your students and they too will be able to organize and understand the questions of linear algebra.</p>"

"<div><p>The bestselling author of <em>The Elegant Universe</em> and <em>The Fabric of the Cosmos</em> tackles perhaps the most mind-bending question in modern physics and cosmology: Is our universe the only universe?<br></p><p>There was a time when \"universe\" meant all there is. Everything. Yet, a number of theories are converging on the possibility that our universe may be but one among many parallel universes populating a vast multiverse. Here, Briane Greene, one of our foremost physicists and science writers, takes us on a breathtaking journey to a multiverse comprising an endless series of big bangs, a multiverse with duplicates of every one of us, a multiverse populated by vast sheets of spacetime, a multiverse in which all we consider real are holographic illusions, and even a multiverse made purely of math--and reveals the reality hidden within each.<br></p><p>Using his trademark wit and precision, Greene presents a thrilling survey of cutting-edge physics and confronts the inevitable question: How can fundamental science progress if great swaths of reality lie beyond our reach? <em>The Hidden Reality</em> is a remarkable adventure through a world more vast and strange than anything we could have imagined.</p><h3>Amazon.com Review</h3><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, January 2011</strong>: Take any of physics' major theories of the fundamental nature of the universe, extrapolate its math to the logical extreme, and you get some version of a (so far unobservable) parallel universe. And who better to navigate these hypothetical versions of the \"multiverse\" than Brian Greene? Normally an unflinching apologist for string theory, the bestselling author of <em>The Elegant Universe</em> and <em>The Fabric of the Cosmos</em> here treats all viable alternate realities to a laudably fair shake. For a book exploring the most far-reaching implications of bleeding-edge mathematics, <em>The Hidden Reality</em> is surprisingly light on math, written as it is \"for a broad audience … its only prerequisite the will to persevere.\" Such perseverance pays off with a motley cast of potential universes featuring doppelgängers, strings, branes, quantum probabilities, holographs, and simulated worlds. The result is that rare accomplishment in science writing for a popular audience: a volume that explains the science and its consequences while stimulating the imagination of even the uninitiated. </p><p><strong>Oliver Sacks on *The Hidden Reality</strong>*</p><p><strong>Oliver Sacks was born in London and educated in London, Oxford, California, and New York. He is professor of neurology and psychiatry at Columbia University, and Columbia's first University Artist. He is the author of many books, including <em>Awakenings</em>, <em>The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat</em>, and <em>Musicophilia</em>. His newest book, <em>The Mind's Eye</em>, was published in October, 2010.</strong></p><p>Brian Greene is not only a profound cosmological thinker--a pioneer of string theory--but a writer of exceptional clarity and charm. His books--<em>The Elegant Universe</em> and <em>The Fabric of the Cosmos</em> among them--take one ever deeper into a universe stranger and more wonderful than anyone could have conceived a generation ago. <em>The Hidden Reality</em> takes us deeper still, and it has a special personal quality and warmth that is evident from the opening of the book, when Greene recollects how, as a boy, he was fascinated by the multiple reflections in parallel mirrors. He has never lost this childlike wonder at the world of physics, but he brings it now to examining theories of multiple universes, of the continual birth of universes, starting long before our own. . . and destined to continue, perhaps, to the end of time.</p><p>In the 1930s, as a boy myself, I read <em>The Mysterious Universe</em> by James Jeans. Jeans was, like Greene, a brilliant theoretical astronomer and equally mesmerizing writer. I thought Jeans's book was the most exciting, revelatory book I had ever read, and now, seventy years later, I feel the same excitement reading Brian Greene's new book, where every chapter opens level after level of previously unimaginable, mind-expanding realities.</p><hr><h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Starred Review. \"There was a time when ÿuniverse' meant ÿall there is,' \" writes Greene, but soon we may have to redefine that word, along with our own meager understanding of the cosmos. A theoretical physicist and celebrated author, Greene offers intrepid readers another in-depth yet marvelously accessible look inside the perplexing world of modern theoretical physics and cosmology. Greene's book The Elegant Universe explained late 20th-century efforts to find a unified theory of everything, culminating with string theory. But string theory opened up a new can of worms, hinting at the possible existence of multiple universes and other strange entities. The possibility of other universes existing alongside our own like holes in \"a gigantic block of Swiss cheese\" seems more likely every day. Beginning with relativity theory, the Big Bang, and our expanding universe, Greene introduces first the mind-blowing multiplicity of forms those parallel universes might take, from patchwork quilts or stretchy \"branes\" to landscapes and holograms riddled with black holes. With his inspired analogies starring everyone from South Park's Eric Cartman to Ms. Pac-Man and a can of Pringles, Greene presents a lucid, intriguing, and triumphantly understandable state-of-the-art look at the universe.

"<p class=\"description\">Computer modeling is now an integral part of research in evolutionary biology. The advent of increased processing power in the personal computer, coupled with the availability of languages such as R, SPLUS, Mathematica, Maple, Mathcad, and MATLAB, has ensured that the development and analysis of computer models of evolution is now within the capabilities of most graduate students. However, there are two hurdles that tend to discourage students from making full use of the power of computer modeling. The first is the general problem of formulating the question and the second is its implementation using an appropriate computer language.Modelling Evolution outlines how evolutionary questions are formulated and how, in practice, they can be resolved by analytical and numerical methods (with the emphasis being on the latter). Following a general introduction to computer modeling, successive chapters describe \"Fisherian\" optimality models, invasibility analysis, genetic models, game theoretic models, and dynamic programming. A common chapter plan facilitates tuition and comprises an introduction (in which the general approach and methods are described) followed by a series of carefully structured scenarios that have been selected to highlight particular aspects of evolutionary modeling. Coding for each example is provided in either R or MATLAB since both of these programs are readily available and extensively used. This coding is available on the author's web site allowing easy implementation and study of the programs. Each chapter concludes with a list of exemplary papers which have been chosen on the basis of how well they explain and illustrate the techniques discussed in the chapter.</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">\"In this book the authors try to bridge the gap between the treatments of matrix theory and linear algebra to be found in current textbooks and the mastery of these topics required to use and apply our subject matter in several important areas of application, as well as in mathematics itself. At the same time we present a treatment that is as self-contained as is reasonable possible, beginning with the most fundamental ideas and definitions. In order to accomplish this double purpose, the first few chapters include a complete treatment of material to be found in standard courses on matrices and linear algebra. This part includes development of a computational algebraic development (in the spirit of the first edition) and also development of the abstract methods of finite-dimensional linear spaces. Indeed, a balance is maintained through the book between the two powerful techniques of matrix algebra and the theory of linear spaces and transformations.\" --1st paragraph of preface.</p>"

Then, using practical examples, we demonstrate how Perl's distinguishing features make it particularly well suited to perform labor intensive and sophisticated tasks ranging from the preparation of data to the writing of statistical reports. In Part II we show how Perl can be extended to perform statistical computations using modules and by \"embedding\" specialized statistical applications. We provide example on how Perl can be used to do simple statistical analyses, perform complex statistical computations involving matrix algebra and numerical optimization, and make statistical computations more easily reproducible. We also investigate the numerical and statistical reliability of various Perl statistical modules.

"<div><p>It is only a slight exaggeration to say that the British mathematician Alan Turing (1912-1954) saved the Allies from the Nazis, invented the computer and artificial intelligence, and anticipated gay liberation by decades--all before his suicide at age forty-one. This classic biography of the founder of computer science, reissued on the centenary of his birth with a substantial new preface by the author, is the definitive account of an extraordinary mind and life. A gripping story of mathematics, computers, cryptography, and homosexual persecution, Andrew Hodges's acclaimed book captures both the inner and outer drama of Turing's life.</p><p>Hodges tells how Turing's revolutionary idea of 1936--the concept of a universal machine--laid the foundation for the modern computer and how Turing brought the idea to practical realization in 1945 with his electronic design. The book also tells how this work was directly related to Turing's leading role in breaking the German Enigma ciphers during World War II, a scientific triumph that was critical to Allied victory in the Atlantic. At the same time, this is the tragic story of a man who, despite his wartime service, was eventually arrested, stripped of his security clearance, and forced to undergo a humiliating treatment program--all for trying to live honestly in a society that defined homosexuality as a crime.</p><h3>Amazon.com Review</h3><p>Alan Turing died in 1954, but the themes of his life epitomize the turn of the millennium. A pure mathematician from a tradition that prided itself on its impracticality, Turing laid the foundations for modern computer science, writes Andrew Hodges:</p><blockquote><p>Alan had proved that there was no \"miraculous machine\" that could solve all mathematical problems, but in the process he had discovered something almost equally miraculous, the idea of a universal machine that could take over the work of <em>any</em> machine.</p></blockquote><p>During World War II, Turing was the intellectual star of Bletchley Park, the secret British cryptography unit. His work cracking the German's Enigma machine code was, in many ways, the first triumph of computer science. And Turing died because his identity as a homosexual was incompatible with cold-war ideas of security, implemented with machines and remorseless logic: \"It was his own invention, and it killed the goose that laid the golden eggs.\"</p><p>Andrew Hodges's remarkable insight weaves Turing's mathematical and computer work with his personal life to produce one of the best biographies of our time, and the basis of the Derek Jacobi movie <em>Breaking the Code</em>. Hodges has the mathematical knowledge to explain the intellectual significance of Turing's work, while never losing sight of the human and social picture: </p><blockquote><p>In this sense his life belied his work, for it could not be contained by the discrete state machine. At every stage his life raised questions about the connection (or lack of it) between the mind and the body, thought and action, intelligence and operations, science and society, the individual and history.</p></blockquote><p>And Hodges admits what all biographers know, but few admit, about their subjects: \"his inner code remains unbroken.\" Alan Turing is still an enigma. <em>--Mary Ellen Curtin</em></p><h3>Review</h3><p>One of the finest scientific biographies ever written.

Written by a mathematician, it describes in plain language Turing's work on the foundations of computer science and how he broke the Germans' Enigma code in the Second World War.

"<div><p><strong> \"Riveting and comprehensive, encompassing every aspect of the rise of military robotics.\" --<em>Financial Times</em> </strong><br></p><p>In <em>Wired for War</em>, P. W. Singer explores the great­est revolution in military affairs since the atom bomb: the dawn of robotic warfare. We are on the cusp of a massive shift in military technology that threatens to make real the stuff of <em>I, Robot</em> and <em>The Terminator</em>. Blending historical evidence with interviews of an amaz­ing cast of characters, Singer shows how technology is changing not just how wars are fought, but also the politics, economics, laws, and the ethics that surround war itself. Traveling from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan to modern-day \"skunk works\" in the midst of suburbia, Wired for War will tantalize a wide readership, from military buffs to policy wonks to gearheads.<br></p><h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Brookings Institute fellow Singer (<em>Children at War</em>) believes that we resist trying to research and understand change in the making of war. Robotics promises to be the most comprehensive instrument of change in war since the introduction of gunpowder. Beginning with a brief and useful survey of robotics, Singer discusses its military applications during WWII, the arming and autonomy of robots at the turn of the century, and the broad influence of robotics on near-future battlefields. How, for example, can rules of engagement for unmanned autonomous machines be created and enforced? Can an artificial intelligence commit a war crime? Arguably more significant is Singers provocative case that war itself will be redefined as technology creates increasing physical and emotional distance from combat. As robotics diminishes wars risks the technology diminishes as well the higher purposes traditionally used to justify it. Might that reduce humanitys propensity for war making? Or will robotics make war less humane by making it less human? Singer has more questions than answers—but it is difficult to challenge his concluding admonition to question and study the technologies of military robotics—while the chance remains. <em>(Jan. 26)</em> <br>Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

"<p>Statistics is the activity of inferring results about a population given a sample. Historically, statistics books assume an underlying distribution to the data (typically, the normal distribution) and derive results under that assumption. Unfortunately, in real life, one cannot normally be sure of the underlying distribution. For that reason, this book presents a distribution-independent approach to statistics based on a simple computational counting idea called resampling. This book explains the basic concepts of resampling, then system atically presents the standard statistical measures along with programs (in the language Python) to calculate them using resampling, and finally illustrates the use of the measures and programs in a case study. The text uses junior high school algebra and many examples to explain the concepts. The ideal reader has mastered at least elementary mathematics, likes to think procedurally, and is comfortable with computers.

"<p class=\"description\">In this critically acclaimed book, first published in 1988 and now reprinted in paperback, scientist and author Paul Davies explains how recent scientific advances are transforming our understanding of the emergence of complexity and organization in the universe. Melding a variety of ideas and disciplines from biology, fundamental physics, computer science, mathematics, genetics, and neurology, Davies presents his provocative theory on the source of the universe's creative potency. He explores the new paradigm (replacing the centuries-old Newtonian view of the universe) that recognizes the collective and holistic properties of physical systems and the power of self-organization. He casts the laws in physics in the role of a \"blueprint,\" embodying a grand cosmic scheme that progressively unfolds as the universe develops.Challenging the viewpoint that the physical universe is a meaningless collection particles, he finds overwhelming evidence for an underlying purpose: \"Science may explain all the processes whereby the universe evolves its own destiny, but that still leaves room for there to be a meaning behind existence.\"</p>"
"<p class=\"description\">Advanced Mathematical Thinking has played a central role in the development of human civilization for over two millennia. Yet in all that time the serious study of the nature of advanced mathematical thinking – what it is, how it functions in the minds of expert mathematicians, how it can be encouraged and improved in the developing minds of students – has been limited to the reflections of a few significant individuals scattered throughout the history of mathematics. In the twentieth century the theory of mathematical education during the compulsory years of schooling to age 16 has developed its own body of empirical research, theory and practice. But the extensions of such theories to more advanced levels have only occurred in the last few years. In 1976 The International Group for the Psychology of Mathematics (known as PME) was formed and has met annually at different venues round the world to share research ideas. In 1985 a Working Group of PME was formed to focus on Advanced Mathematical Thinking with a major aim of producing this volume. The text begins with an introductory chapter on the psychology of advanced mathema- cal thinking, with the remaining chapters grouped under three headings: • the nature of advanced mathematical thinking, • cognitive theory, and • reviews of the progress of cognitive research into different areas of advanced mathematics.</p>"

Yet the theories collide horribly under extreme conditions such as black holes or times close to the big bang. Brian Greene, a specialist in quantum field theory, believes that the two pillars of physics can be reconciled in superstring theory, a theory of everything.</p><p>Superstring theory has been called \"a part of 21st-century physics that fell by chance into the 20th century.\" In other words, it isn't all worked out yet. Despite the uncertainties--\"string theorists work to find approximate solutions to approximate equations\"--Greene gives a tour of string theory solid enough to satisfy the scientifically literate.</p><p>Though Ed Witten of the Institute for Advanced Study is in many ways the human hero of <em>The Elegant Universe</em>, it is not a human-side-of-physics story. Greene's focus throughout is the science, and he gives the nonspecialist at least an illusion of understanding--or the sense of knowing what it is that you don't know. And that is traditionally the first step on the road to knowledge. <em>--Mary Ellen Curtin</em></p><h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3><p>One of the more compelling scientific (cum-theological) questions in the Middle Ages was: \"How many angels can dance on the head of a pin?\" Today's version in cutting-edge science is, \"How many strings... ?\" As posited by s tring theory physics, strings are furiously vibrating loops of stuff. The concept of strings was devised to help scientists describe simultaneously both energy and matter. The frequency and resonance of strings' vibration, just like those of strings on an instrument, determine charge, spin and other familiar properties of energy?and eventually the structure of the universe: a true music of the spheres. There's a chance that strings are themselves made up of something still smaller. But scientists can prove their existence only on the blackboard and computer, because they are much too tiny?a hundred billion billion times smaller than the nucleus of an atom?to be observed experimentally. Brian Greene, professor of physics and mathematics at Cornell and Columbia universities, makes the terribly complex theory of strings accessible to all. He possesses a remarkable gift for using the everyday to illustrate what may be going on in dimensions beyond our feeble human perception. Just when we might be tempted to dismiss strings as grist for the publish-or-perish mill, Greene explains how they have demonstrated connections between mathematics and physics that have helped solve age-old conundrums in each field. This book will appeal to astronomy as well as math and physics fans because it probes the important insights string theory gives into hotly debated issues in cosmology. Later chapters require careful attention to Greene's explications, but the effort will prepare readers to follow the scientific advances likely to be made in the next millennium through application of string theory.

"<p>In the age of global biotechnology, DNA can exist as biological material in a test tube, as a sequence in a computer database, and as economically valuable information in a patent. In The Global Genome, Eugene Thacker asks us to consider the relationship of these three entities and argues that -- by their existence and their interrelationships -- they are fundamentally redefining the notion of biological \"life itself.\" Biological science and the biotech industry are increasingly organized at a global level, in large part because of the use of the Internet in exchanging biological data. International genome sequencing efforts, genomic databases, the development of World Intellectual Property policies, and the \"borderless\" business of biotech are all evidence of the global intersections of biology and informatics -- of genetic codes and computer codes. Thacker points out the internal tension in the very concept of biotechnology: the products are more \"tech\" than \"bio,\" but the technology itself is fully biological, composed of the biomaterial labor of genes, proteins, cells, and tissues. Is biotechnology a technology at all, he asks, or is it a notion of \"life itself\" that is inseparable from its use in the biotech industry?The three sections of the book cover the three primary activities of biotechnology today: the encoding of biological materials into digital form -- as in bioinformatics and genomics; its recoding in various ways -- including the \"biocolonialism\" of mapping genetically isolated ethnic populations and the newly pervasive concern over \"biological security\"; and its decoding back into biological materiality -- as in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Thacker moves easily from science to philosophy to political economics, enlivening his account with ideas from such thinkers as Georges Bataille, Georges Canguilhem, Michel Foucault, Antonio Negri, and Paul Virilio. The \"global genome,\" says Thacker, makes it impossible to consider biotechnology without the context of globalism.</p>"

In her latest, the future is even bleaker. The triple whammy of runaway social inequality, genetic technology and catastrophic climate change, has finally culminated in some apocalyptic event. As Jimmy, apparently the last human being on earth, makes his way back to the RejoovenEsencecompound for supplies, the reader is transported backwards toward that cataclysmic event, its full dimensions gradually revealed. Jimmy grew up in a world split between corporate compounds (gated communities metastasized into city-states) and pleeblands (unsafe, populous and polluted urban centers). His best friend was \"Crake,\" the name originally his handle in an interactive Net game, Extinctathon. Even Jimmy's mother-who ran off and joined an ecology guerrilla group when Jimmy was an adolescent-respected Crake, already a budding genius. The two friends first encountered Oryx on the Net; she was the eight-year-old star of a pedophilic film on a site called HottTotts. Oryx's story is a counterpoint to Jimmy and Crake's affluent adolescence. She was sold by her Southeast Asian parents, taken to the city and eventually made into a sex \"pixie\" in some distant country. Jimmy meets Oryx much later-after college, after Crake gets Jimmy a job with ReJoovenEsence. Crake is designing the Crakers-a new, multicolored placid race of human beings, smelling vaguely of citron. He's procured Oryx to be his personal assistant. She teaches the Crakers how to cope in the world and goes out on secret missions. The mystery on which this riveting, disturbing tale hinges is how Crake and Oryx and civilization vanished, and how Jimmy-who also calls himself \"the Snowman,\" after that other rare, hunted specimen, the Abominable Snowman-survived. Chesterton once wrote of the \"thousand romances that lie secreted in The Origin of Species.\" Atwood has extracted one of the most hair-raising of them, and one of the most brilliant. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc. </p></div><font size=\"2\">\n\nSUMMARY:\nA stunning and provocative new novel by the internationally celebrated author of The Blind Assassin, winner of the Booker Prize\n\nMargaret Atwood’s new novel is so utterly compelling, so prescient, so relevant, so terrifyingly-all-too-likely-to-be-true, that readers may find their view of the world forever changed after reading it.This is Margaret Atwood at the absolute peak of her powers. For readers of Oryx and Crake, nothing will ever look the same again.\n\nThe narrator of Atwood's riveting novel calls himself Snowman. When the story opens, he is sleeping in a tree, wearing an old bedsheet, mourning the loss of his beloved Oryx and his best friend Crake, and slowly starving to death. He searches for supplies in a wasteland where insects proliferate and pigoons and wolvogs ravage the pleeblands, where ordinary people once lived, and the Compounds that sheltered the extraordinary. As he tries to piece together what has taken place, the narrative shifts to decades earlier. How did everything fall apart so quickly? Why is he left with nothing but his haunting memories? Alone except for the green-eyed Children of Crake, who think of him as a kind of monster, he explores the answers to these questions in the double journey he takes - into his own past, and back to Crake's high-tech bubble-dome, where the Paradice Project unfolded and the world came to grief.\n\nSUMMARY: In Oryx and Crake, a science fiction novel that is more Swift than Heinlein, more cautionary tale than \"fictional science\" (no flying cars here), Margaret Atwood depicts a near-future world that turns from the merely horrible to the horrific, from a fool's paradise to a bio-wasteland.

"<p>Arguably the most intricate dynamic object in the universe, the human brain is an unsounded source of wonder for the scientific community. The primary aim of this book is to provide both students and established investigators in the growing area of neuroscience with an appreciation of the roles that mathematics may play in helping to understand this enigmatic organ. Along with discussions of results obtained by the neuroscience community, emphasis is placed on suggesting fruitful research problems for those planning to embark on mathematical studies in neuroscience. To make the overall perspectives understandable to philosophers and psychologists, essential features of the discussions are presented in ordinary English, with more detailed mathematical comments in appendices and footnotes. Although it attempts to maintain both clarity and biological relevance, this is not a text on the anatomy of nerve systems; thus readers should bring some knowledge of neurophysiology through other courses, associated studies, or laboratory research. It is a guiding theme throughout the book that the brain is organized into several quite different levels of dynamic activity. As will be seen, these levels are hierarchically structured, beginning with the molecular dynamics of intrinsic membrane proteins and proceeding upward, through the switching properties of active membrane patches and synapses, the emergence of impulses on active fibers, overall properties of individual neurons, and the growth of functional assemblies of interacting neurons, to the global dynamics of a brain. At each level of description, reality turns different facets of her mystery to us, and diverse phenomena make their contributions to the brain's collective behavior.\"</p>"

"<p>Robert Kaplan's The Nothing That Is: A Natural History of Zero was an international best-seller, translated into ten languages. The Times called it \"elegant, discursive, and littered with quotes and allusions from Aquinas via Gershwin to Woolf\" and The Philadelphia Inquirer praised it as \"absolutely scintillating.\"<br>In this delightful new book, Robert Kaplan, writing together with his wife Ellen Kaplan, once again takes us on a witty, literate, and accessible tour of the world of mathematics. Where The Nothing That Is looked at math through the lens of zero, The Art of the Infinite takes infinity, in its countless guises, as a touchstone for understanding mathematical thinking. Tracing a path from Pythagoras, whose great Theorem led inexorably to a discovery that his followers tried in vain to keep secret (the existence of irrational numbers); through Descartes and Leibniz; to the brilliant, haunted Georg Cantor, who proved that infinity can come in different sizes, the Kaplans show how the attempt to grasp the ungraspable embodies the essence of mathematics. The Kaplans guide us through the \"Republic of Numbers,\" where we meet both its upstanding citizens and more shadowy dwellers; and we travel across the plane of geometry into the unlikely realm where parallel lines meet. Along the way, deft character studies of great mathematicians (and equally colorful lesser ones) illustrate the opposed yet intertwined modes of mathematical thinking: the intutionist notion that we discover mathematical truth as it exists, and the formalist belief that math is true because we invent consistent rules for it. <br>\"Less than All,\" wrote William Blake, \"cannot satisfy Man.\" The Art of the Infinite shows us some of the ways that Man has grappled with All, and reveals mathematics as one of the most exhilarating expressions of the human imagination.</p>"

"<p>This book is based on a one-semester course for advanced undergraduates specializing in physical chemistry. I am aware that the mathematical training of most science majors is more heavily weighted towards analysis typ- ally calculus and differential equations than towards algebra. But it remains my conviction that the basic ideas and applications of group theory are not only vital, but not dif?cult to learn, even though a formal mathematical setting with emphasis on rigor and completeness is not the place where most chemists would feel most comfortable in learning them. The presentation here is short, and limited to those aspects of symmetry and group theory that are directly useful in interpreting molecular structure and spectroscopy. Nevertheless I hope that the reader will begin to sense some of the beauty of the subject. Symmetry is at the heart of our understanding of the physical laws of nature. If a reader is happy with what appears in this book, I must count this a success. But if the book motivates a reader to move deeper into the subject, I shall be grati?ed.\"</p>"

"<p>Most Perl programmers were originally trained as C and Unix programmers, so the Perl programs that they write bear a strong resemblance to C programs. However, Perl incorporates many features that have their roots in other languages such as Lisp. These advanced features are not well understood and are rarely used by most Perl programmers, but they are very powerful. They can automate tasks in everyday programming that are difficult to solve in any other way. One of the most powerful of these techniques is writing functions that manufacture or modify other functions. For example, instead of writing ten similar functions, a programmer can write a general pattern or framework that can then create the functions as needed according to the pattern. For several years Mark Jason Dominus has worked to apply functional programming techniques to Perl. Now Mark brings these flexible programming methods that he has successfully taught in numerous tutorials and training sessions to a wider audience. <br><em> Introduces powerful programming methodsnew to most Perl programmersthat were previously the domain of computer scientists<br></em> Gradually builds up confidence by describing techniques of progressive sophistication<br>* Shows how to improve everyday programs and includes numerous engaging code examples to illustrate the methods\"</p>"

At one level <em>Brains</em> is a charming autobiography; at another a vivid personal account of 50 years in the evolution of neuroscience. But it also lays down a challenge to the mainstream view that simple, sequential analysis of nerve cells and their responses can explain the apparently impossible task of seeing the world as it really is on the basis of the infinitely ambiguous retinal image. <em>Brains</em> is a delight--for its insights into both the scientists and the science of the brain.\"</p><p>--<strong>Colin Blakemore</strong>, Universities of Oxford and Warwick</p><p>\"Dale Purves has been a leading figure in brain science for 40 years: He has made numerous discoveries, founded departments, and written major textbooks. In <em>Brains</em>, he tells the story of his scientific journey and intertwines it in an elegant and accessible way with two others: the uneven progress of the field over the past half century and the new view of brain function to which the field's shortcomings have led him. Some neuroscientists are likely to disagree with Purves' heretical theories, but none can afford to ignore them.\"</p><p>--<strong>Joshua R.

The first half of the book tracks his odyssey through two of the linchpin departments of the new discipline, those at Harvard Medical School and University College London, to introduce the basic principles of neuroscience for nonspecialists. The book's second half encapsulates Purves' major contribution to the field of neuroscience, and particularly to visual neuroscience. The experimental tools developed during the past half century provide us with an excellent picture of the activity of individual neurons. At the same time, these tools seduce neuroscientists into a reductionist approach that focuses on the microscopic details of visual analysis. Perhaps owing to his training in philosophy, Purves recognized the evolutionary importance of the way that we see: The brain does not report an objective reality but instead provides its best guess at that reality on the basis of the fragmentary information at hand. The brain can be misled by unusual and contrived visual inputs--the basis of visual 'illusions'--but this scarcely represents a defect: The brain interprets patterns of light, darkness, and color on the basis of the most plausible natural stimuli, and it remains for researchers to learn how this interpretation comes about. <em>Brains</em> offers a guide to thinking like a neuroscientist.\"</p><p>--<strong>A.

"<p class=\"description\">This text for a second course in linear algebra is aimed at math majors and graduate students. The novel approach taken here banishes determinants to the end of the book and focuses on the central goal of linear algebra: understanding the structure of linear operators on vector spaces. The author has taken unusual care to motivate concepts and to simplify proofs. For example, the book presents - without having defined determinants - a clean proof that every linear operator on a finite-dimensional complex vector space (or an odd-dimensional real vector space) has an eigenvalue. A variety of interesting exercises in each chapter helps students understand and manipulate the objects of linear algebra. This second edition includes a new section on orthogonal projections and minimization problems. The sections on self-adjoint operators, normal operators, and the spectral theorem have been rewritten. New examples and new exercises have been added, several proofs have been simplified, and hundreds of minor improvements have been made throughout the text.</p>"
"<p>The human genome of three billion letters has been sequenced. So have the genomes of thousands of other organisms.

A huge gap separates our knowledge of the components of a cell and what is known from our observations of its physiology. The authors have written this graduate textbook to explore what has been done to close this gap of understanding between the realms of molecules and biological processes. They have gathered together illustrative mechanisms and models of gene regulatory networks, DNA replication, the cell cycle, cell death, differentiation, cell senescence, and the abnormal state of cancer cells. The mechanisms are biomolecular in detail, and the models are mathematical in nature.

"<p class=\"description\">From Brian Greene, one of the world’s leading physicists and author the Pulitzer Prize finalist The Elegant Universe, comes a grand tour of the universe that makes us look at reality in a completely different way.Space and time form the very fabric of the cosmos. Yet they remain among the most mysterious of concepts. Is space an entity? Why does time have a direction? Could the universe exist without space and time? Can we travel to the past? Greene has set himself a daunting task: to explain non-intuitive, mathematical concepts like String Theory, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, and Inflationary Cosmology with analogies drawn from common experience. From Newton’s unchanging realm in which space and time are absolute, to Einstein’s fluid conception of spacetime, to quantum mechanics’ entangled arena where vastly distant objects can instantaneously coordinate their behavior, Greene takes us all, regardless of our scientific backgrounds, on an irresistible and revelatory journey to the new layers of reality that modern physics has discovered lying just beneath the surface of our everyday world.From the Trade Paperback edition.</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">By David BeazleyAs an educator, researcher, and book author, I am delighted to see the completion of this book. Python is a fun and extremely easy-to-use programming language that has steadily gained in popularity over the last few years. Developed over ten years ago by Guido van Rossum, Python’s simple syntax and overall feel is largely derived from ABC, a teaching language that was developed in the 1980’s. However, Python was also created to solve real problems and it borrows a wide variety of features from programming languages such as C++, Java, Modula-3, and Scheme. Because of this, one of Python’s most remarkable features is its broad appeal to professional software developers, scientists, researchers, artists, and educators. ....David BeazleyUniversity of ChicagoAuthor of the Python Essential Reference</p>"
"<div><p>The study of classical electromagnetic fields is an adventure. The theory is complete mathematically and we are able to present it as an example of classical Newtonian experimental and mathematical philosophy. There is a set of foundational experiments, on which most of the theory is constructed. And then there is the bold theoretical proposal of a field-field interaction from James Clerk Maxwell.  </p><p>This textbook presents the theory of classical fields as a mathematical structure based solidly on laboratory experiments. Here the student is introduced to the beauty of classical field theory as a gem of theoretical physics. To keep the discussion fluid, the history is placed in a beginning chapter and some of the mathematical proofs in the appendices. Chapters on Green's Functions and Laplace's Equation and a discussion of Faraday's Experiment further deepen the understanding. The chapter on Einstein's relativity is an integral necessity to the text. Finally, chapters on particle motion and waves in a dispersive medium complete the picture. High quality diagrams and detailed end-of-chapter questions enhance the learning experience.\"</p></div>"
"<div><p>A global account of the rise of civilization that is also a stunning refutation of ideas of human development based on race.<br>Until around 11,000 b.c., all peoples were still Stone Age hunter/gatherers. At that point, a great divide occurred in the rates that human societies evolved. In Eurasia, parts of the Americas, and Africa, farming became the prevailing mode of existence when indigenous wild plants and animals were domesticated by prehistoric planters and herders. As Jared Diamond vividly reveals, the very people who gained a head start in producing food would collide with preliterate cultures, shaping the modern world through conquest, displacement, and genocide.  </p><p>The paths that lead from scattered centers of food to broad bands of settlement had a great deal to do with climate and geography. But how did differences in societies arise? Why weren't native Australians, Americans, or Africans the ones to colonize Europe? Diamond dismantles pernicious racial theories tracing societal differences to biological differences.  </p><p>He assembles convincing evidence linking germs to domestication of animals, germs that Eurasians then spread in epidemic proportions in their voyages of discovery. In its sweep, <em>Guns, Germs and Steel</em> encompasses the rise of agriculture, technology, writing, government, and religion, providing a unifying theory of human history as intriguing as the histories of dinosaurs and glaciers.  </p><p>Jared Diamond, professor of physiology at the UCLA Medical School, is the author of <em>The Third Chimpanzee</em>, awarded the 1992 <em>Los Angeles Times Science Book Award</em>.

"SUMMARY: For over fifty years, J.R.R. Tolkien’s peerless fantasy has accumulated worldwide acclaim as the greatest adventure tale ever written.No other writer has created a world as distinct as Middle-earth, complete with its own geography, history, languages, and legends. And no one has created characters as endearing as Tolkien’s large-hearted, hairy-footed hobbits. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings continues to seize the imaginations of readers of all ages, and this new three-volume paperback edition is designed to appeal to the youngest of them.In ancient times the Rings of Power were crafted by the Elvensmiths, and Sauron, the Dark Lord, forged the One Ring, filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others. But the One Ring was taken from him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, still it remained lost to him . . ."
"<p class=\"description\">Who are computer hackers? What is free software? And what does the emergence of a community dedicated to the production of free and open source software--and to hacking as a technical, aesthetic, and moral project--reveal about the values of contemporary liberalism? Exploring the rise and political significance of the free and open source software (F/OSS) movement in the United States and Europe, Coding Freedom details the ethics behind hackers' devotion to F/OSS, the social codes that guide its production, and the political struggles through which hackers question the scope and direction of copyright and patent law. In telling the story of the F/OSS movement, the book unfolds a broader narrative involving computing, the politics of access, and intellectual property.  E. Gabriella Coleman tracks the ways in which hackers collaborate and examines passionate manifestos, hacker humor, free software project governance, and festive hacker conferences. Looking at the ways that hackers sustain their productive freedom, Coleman shows that these activists, driven by a commitment to their work, reformulate key ideals including free speech, transparency, and meritocracy, and refuse restrictive intellectual protections. Coleman demonstrates how hacking, so often marginalized or misunderstood, sheds light on the continuing relevance of liberalism in online collaboration.</p>"
"<p class=\"description\">Genetic algorithms have been used in science and engineering as adaptive algorithms for solving practical problems and as computational models of natural evolutionary systems. This brief, accessible introduction describes some of the most interesting research in the field and also enables readers to implement and experiment with genetic algorithms on their own. It focuses in depth on a small set of important and interesting topics -- particularly in machine learning, scientific modeling, and artificial life -- and reviews a broad span of research, including the work of Mitchell and her colleagues.The descriptions of applications and modeling projects stretch beyond the strict boundaries of computer science to include dynamical systems theory, game theory, molecular biology, ecology, evolutionary biology, and population genetics, underscoring the exciting \"general purpose\" nature of genetic algorithms as search methods that can be employed across disciplines. An Introduction to Genetic Algorithms is accessible to students and researchers in any scientific discipline. It includes many thought and computer exercises that build on and reinforce the reader's understanding of the text.The first chapter introduces genetic algorithms and their terminology and describes two provocative applications in detail. The second and third chapters look at the use of genetic algorithms in machine learning (computer programs, data analysis and prediction, neural networks) and in scientific models (interactions among learning, evolution, and culture; sexual selection; ecosystems; evolutionary activity). Several approaches to the theory of genetic algorithms are discussed in depth in the fourth chapter. The fifth chapter takes up implementation, and the last chapter poses some currently unanswered questions and surveys prospects for the future of evolutionary computation.</p>"

For example, it has been known for centuries how to explicitely solve polynomial equations of degree 2 (Baby- nians, many centuries ago), 3 (Scipione del Ferro, Tartaglia, Cardan, around th 1500a.d.), and even 4 (Cardan, Ferrari, xvi century), using only algebraic operations and radicals (nth roots). However, the case of degree 5 remained unsolved until Abel showed in 1826 that a general equation of degree 5 cannot be solved that way.

"<p class=\"description\">For decades, books on bioinformatics have primarily served gene-hunters, and biologists who wished to construct family trees showing tidy lines of descent. This trend has continued in most subsequent texts, which deal extensively with gene discovery and searching databases, but hardly consider genomes as information channels through which multiple forms and levels of information, including genic information, have passed through the generations. Written to make the 'new' information-based (rather than gene-based) bioinformatics intelligible both to the 'bio' and the 'info' audience, this book identifies the types of information that genomes transmit, shows how competition between different types is resolved in the genomes of different organisms, and identifies the evolutionary forces involved. The early chapters relate the form of information with which we are most familiar, namely written texts, to the DNA text that is our genome. This lends itself well to introducing historical aspects dating back to the nineteenth century.</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">Biological and biomedical sciences are becoming more interdisciplinary, and scientists of the future need inte rdisciplinary training instead of the conventional disciplinary training. Just as Sean Eddy (2005) wiselypointed out that sending monolingual diplomats to the United Nations maynot enhance international collaborations, combining strictly disciplinary scientists trained in either mathematics, computational science or molecular biology will not create a productive inte rdisciplinary team ready to solve interdisciplinary problems. Molecular biology is an interdiscip linary science back in its heyday, and founders of molecular biology were ofte n interdisciplinary scientists. Indeed, Francis Crick considered himself as “a mixture of crystallographer, biophysicist, biochemist, and geneticist” (Crick, 1965). Because it was too cumbersome to explain to people that he was such a mixture, the term “molecular biologist” came handy. To get the crystallographer, biophysicist, biochemist, and geneticist within hi mself to collaborate with each other probably worked better than a team with a crystallographer, a biophysicist, a biochemist and a geneticist who maynot even be interested in each other’s problems.</p>"

"<p>\"Physical Chemistry in Depth\" is not a stand-alone text, but complements the text of any standard textbook on \"Physical Chemistry\" into depth having in mind to provide profound understanding of some of the topics presented in these textbooks. Standard textbooks in Physical Chemistry start with thermodynamics, deal with kinetics, structure of matter, etc. The \"Physical Chemistry in Depth\" follows this adjustment, but adds chapters that are treated traditionally in ordinary textbooks inadequately, e.g., general scaling laws, the graphlike structure of matter, and cross connections between the individual disciplines of Physical Chemistry. Admittedly, the text is loaded with some mathematics, which is a prerequisite to thoroughly understand the topics presented here. However, the mathematics needed is explained at a really low level so that no additional mathematical textbook is needed.</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">This book provides visualizations of many topics in general physics. The aim is to have an interactive MATLAB script wherein the user can vary parameters in a specific problem and then immediately see the outcome by way of dynamic “movies” of the response of the system in question. MATLAB tools are used throughout and the software scripts accompany the text in Symbolic Mathematics, Classical Mechanics, Electromagnetism, Waves and Optics, Gases and Fluid Flow, Quantum Mechanics, Special and General Relativity, and Astrophysics and Cosmology. The emphasis is on building up an intuition by running many different parametric choices chosen actively by the user and watching the subsequent behavior of the system.Physics books using MATLAB do not have the range — or the intent — of this text. They are rather steeped in technical detail. Symbolic math is used extensively and is integral to the aim of using MATLAB tools to accomplish the technical aspects of problem solving.</p>"

In the second part evolutionary time takes center stage and phylogenetic reconstruction, the analysis of sequence variation, and the dynamics of genes in populations are explained in detail. In addition, the book contains a computer program with a graphical user interface that allows the reader to experiment with a number of key concepts developed by the authors.This textbook is intended for students enrolled in courses in computational biology or bioinformatics as well as for molecular biologists, mathematicians, and computer scientists.</p>"
"<p class=\"description\">After a few initial chapters on the basics of Mathematica, the logic of the book is controlled by group theory. It continues to teach Mathematica by example as the need arises, so an important use is always at hand for any new operator that is taught. To many science students, this is a greatly preferred way of learning a new computer language. The main part of the book follows a strictly logical development that should be acceptable to the most rigorous minded people, while maintaining an engaging style in the spirit of Numerical Recipes by Press, Flannery, Teukolsky, and Vetterling. The essence of this style is to be just a little opinionated about good and bad ways to calculate things, but to give such advice without provoking offense, and always on an objective basis. After this comes the development of classes and irreducible representations, culminating in a complete proof that for every group the number of classes is equal to the number of representations, so that all character tables must be square. The proof is motivated throughout by numerical constructions that rouse curiosity, and draw the reader into a rediscovery of Schur�s Lemmas, which thereby become truly interesting results, rather than the mysterious, dry statements often presented. This section culminates in a method for calculating the entire character table of a group. This is especially important for permutation groups that describe flexible molecules, for which are there very few published character tables. Once the character tables are established, the real meat of physical applications can begin. The author emphasizes that every application has the same structure: (1) The construction of a reducible representation on the basis of some physical property, (2) its separation into irreducible components, and (3) the interpretation in terms of the \"symmetry species\" so produced. Because Mathematica and the xyz representations are close at hand, the separation into irreducible components can be done quickly. The CD-ROM included with the book presents the entire content of the book plus interactive examples using notebooks (Version 5.2) for problem solving and learning.</p>"

Since then she has been writing and consulting independently. Her first book was Symmetry In Mechanics: A Gentle, Modern Introduction.The predictive power of mathematics in quantum phenomena is one of the great intellectual successes of the 20th century. This textbook, aimed at undergraduate or graduate level students (depending on the college or university), concentrates on how to make predictions about the numbers of each kind of basic state of a quantum system from only two ingredients: the symmetry and the linear model of quantum mechanics. This method, involving the mathematical area of representation theory or group theory, combines three core mathematical subjects, namely, linear algebra, analysis and abstract algebra. Wide applications of this method occur in crystallography, atomic structure, classification of manifolds with symmetry, and other areas.The topics unfold systematically, introducing the reader first to an important example of a quantum system with symmetry, the single electron in a hydrogen atom. about the numbers of each kind of electronic orbital based solely on the physical spherical symmetry of the hydrogen atom. The final chapters address the related ideas of quantum spin, measurement and entanglement.This user-friendly exposition, driven by numerous examples and exercises, requires a solid background in calculus and familiarity with either linear algebra or advanced quantum mechanics. The Hydrogen Atom: An Introduction to Group and Representation Theory will benefit students in mathematics, physics and chemistry, as well as a literate general readership.

"<p class=\"description\">This book is a compilation of the presentations given at the Fourth International Symposium on Fractals in Biology and Medicine held in Ascona, Switzerland on - th 13 March 2004 and was dedicated to Professor Benoît Mandelbrot in honour of his 80 birthday. The Symposium was the fourth of a series that originated back in 1993, always in Ascona. The fourth volume consists of 29 contributions organized under four sections: Fractal structures in biological systems Fractal structures in neurosciences Fractal structures in tumours and diseases The fractal paradigm Mandelbrot’s concepts such as scale invariance, self-similarity, irregularity and iterative processes as tackled by fractal geometry have prompted innovative ways to promote a real progress in biomedical sciences, namely by understanding and analytically describing complex hierarchical scaling processes, chaotic disordered systems, non-linear dynamic phenomena, standard and anomalous transport diffusion events through membrane surfaces, morphological structures and biological shapes either in physiological or in diseased states. While most of biologic processes could be described by models based on power law behaviour and quantified by a single characteristic parameter [the fractal dimension D], other models were devised for describing fractional time dynamics and fractional space behaviour or both (- fractional mechanisms), that allow to combine the interaction between spatial and functional effects by introducing two fractional parameters.

We explorehownon-commutative(in?nite) groups, which arety- callystudiedincombinatorialgrouptheory, canbeusedinpublickeycryptography. We also show that there is a remarkable feedback from cryptography to com- natorial group theory because some of the problems motivated by cryptography appear to be new to group theory, and they open many interesting research - enues within group theory. Then, we employ complexity theory, notably generic case complexity of algorithms, for cryptanalysisof various cryptographicprotocols based on in?nite groups. We also use the ideas and machinery from the theory of generic case complexity to study asymptotically dominant properties of some in?nite groups that have been used in public key cryptography so far. It turns out that for a relevant cryptographic scheme to be secure, it is essential that keys are selected from a \"very small\" (relative to the whole group, say) subset rather than from the whole group. Detecting these subsets (\"black holes\") for a part- ular cryptographic scheme is usually a very challenging problem, but it holds the keyto creatingsecurecryptographicprimitives basedonin?nite non-commutative groups.

"<p>Group theoretical principles are an integral part of modern chemistry. Not only do they help account for a wide variety of chemical phenomena, they simplify quantum chemical calculations. Indeed, knowledge of their application to chemical problems is essential for students of chemistry. This complete, self-contained study, written for advanced undergraduate-level and graduate-level chemistry students, clearly and concisely introduces the subject of group theory and demonstrates its application to chemical problems.<br>To assist chemistry students with the mathematics involved, Professor Bishop has included the relevant mathematics in some detail in appendices to each chapter. The book can then be read either as an introduction, dealing with general concepts (ignoring the appendices), or a fairly comprehensive description of the subject (including the appendices). In any case, the author assures students that \"the mathematics involved in actually applying, as opposed to deriving, group theoretical formulae is quite trivial. It involves little more than adding and multiplying.\" 1973 edition.</p>"
"<p class=\"description\">The existence of genes for RNA molecules not coding for proteins (ncRNAs) has been recognized since the 1950's, but until recently, aside from the critically important ribosomal and transfer RNA genes, most focus has been on protein coding genes. However, a long series of striking discoveries, from RNA's ability to carry out catalytic function, to discovery of riboswitches, microRNAs and other ribo-regulators performing critical tasks in essentially all living organisms, has created a burgeoning interest in this primordial component of the biosphere. However, the structural characteristics and evolutionary constraints on RNA molecules are very different from those of proteins, necessitating development of a completely new suite of informatic tools to address these challenges. In RNA Sequence, Structure, Function: Computational and Bioinformatic Methods, expert researchers in the field describe a substantial and relevant fraction of these methodologies from both practical and computational/algorithmic perspectives. Focusing on both of these directions addresses both the biologist interested in knowing more about RNA bioinformatics as well as the bioinformaticist interested in more detailed aspects of the algorithms. Written in the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series format, the chapters include the kind of detailed description and implementation advice that is crucial for getting optimal results. Thorough and intuitive, RNA Sequence, Structure, Function: Computational and Bioinformatic Methods aids scientists in continuing to study key methods and principles of RNA bioinformatics.</p>"
"<p class=\"description\">Computational chemistry and molecular modeling is a fast emerging area which is used for the modeling and simulation of small chemical and biological systems in order to understand and predict their behavior at the molecular level. It has a wide range of applications in various disciplines of engineering sciences, such as mate- als science, chemical engineering, biomedical engineering, etc. Knowledge of c- putational chemistry is essential to understand the behavior of nanosystems; it is probably the easiest route or gateway to the fast-growing discipline of nanosciences and nanotechnology, which covers many areas of research dealing with objects that are measured in nanometers and which is expected to revolutionize the industrial sector in the coming decades. Considering the importance of this discipline, computational chemistry is being taught presently as a course at the postgraduate and research level in many univer- ties. This book is the result of the need for a comprehensive textbook on the subject, which was felt by the authors while teaching the course. It covers all the aspects of computational chemistry required for a course, with suf cient illustrations, nume- cal examples, applications, and exercises. For a computational chemist, scientist, or researcher, this book will be highly useful in understanding and mastering the art of chemical computation. Familiarization with common and commercial software in molecular modeling is also incorporated. Moreover, the application of the concepts in related elds such as biomedical engineering, computational drug designing, etc. has been added.</p>"
"<p class=\"description\"> Teaching or learning numerical methods in applied mathematics cannot be conceived nowadays without numerical experimentation on computers. There is a vast literature devoted either to theoretical numerical methods or nuerical programming of basic algorithms, but there are few texts offering a complete discussion of numerical issues involved in the solution of concrete and relatively complex problems. This book is an attempt to fill this need. It is our belief that advantages and drawbacks of a numerical method cannot be accounted for without one’s experiencing all the steps of scientific computing, from physical and mathematical description of the problem to numerical formulation and programming and, finally, to critical discussion of numerical results. The book provides twelve computational projects aimed at numerically solving problems selected to cover a broad spectrum of applications, from ?uid mechanics, chemistry, elasticity, thermal science, computer-aided design, signal and image processing, etc. Even though the main volume of this text concerns the numerical analysis of computational methods and their imp- mentation, we have tried to start, when possible, from realistic problems of practical interest for researchers and engineers. For each project, an introductory record card summarizes the mathem- ical and numerical topics explained and the fields of application of the approach. A level of dificulty, scaling from 1 to 3, is assigned to each project.</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">April 2006 Introduction Bioinformatics is at a crossroads. We work in a field that is changing every day, increasingly moving from specific solutions created by single researchers working alone or in small groups to larger, often geographically dispersed programs enabled by collaborative computing and open software. This book represents an important development, giving the reader an opportunity to discover how the use of open and reusable Java code can solve large bioinformatics problems in a software engineered and robust way. I work with one of the authors of this book every day, on the National Cancer Institute's cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIGTM) project, and I can attest that they are well suited to share with their readers both their experience in the development and use of bioinformatics software, as well as their interest in solid software engineering and interoperability. Background and history In its short history, bioinformatics has become an increasingly important part of how scientists involved in biological research go about their work. This has lead to an explosion of interest in the subject, and a similar explosion in tools and data resources for researchers to learn and use in their work. Historically, tools for bioinformatics have been idiosyncratic and are custom-developed by the end-users (or those close to them) in an iterative fashion until the specific immediate problem is solved. This has led to a balkanization of informatics systems, sometimes yielding multiple, incompatible systems at a single institution for a single application.</p>"

"<p>Images of sweatshop labor in developing countries have rallied opponents of globalization against foreign direct investment (FDI). The controversy is most acute over the treatment of low-skilled workers producing garments, footwear, toys, and sports equipment in foreign-owned plants or the plants of subcontractors. Activists cite low wages, poor working conditions, and a variety of economic, physical, and sexual abuses among the negative consequences of the globalization of industry. In Beyond Sweatshops, Theodore Moran examines the impact of FDI in manufacturing on growth and welfare in developing countries, and explores how host governments can take advantage of the contributions of foreign investment while avoiding the hazards to lower-skilled workers. He traces case studies of countries that have managed to produce steady improvement in worker treatment at plants exporting garments, footwear, and other labor-intensive products. The first part of the book examines multilateral proposals designed to place a floor under the treatment of workers around the world, contrasting a WTO-based system to enforce labor standards with \"voluntary\" arrangements, including corporate codes of conduct, certification organizations, and \"sweatshop free\" labeling. It explores the pros and cons of adding a \"living wage\" requirement to the ILO's core labor standards. The second part of the book presents data that significantly broadens our understanding of FDI. By analyzing the evidence from a variety of developing countries --in Asia, Latin America, and Africa --Moran demonstrates that most FDI goes to industrial sectors that employ trained workers who are not easily exploited. The flow of FDI to plants that produce electronics, auto parts, industrial equipment, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and medical equipment, paying production workers two to five times more than what is found in lower-skilled operations, is twenty-five times the flow to garment, textile, and footwear plants. Appropriately designed host country policies can transform the development trajectory of the entire economy. Moran advocates various \"build-up\" --rather than \"trickle down\" --strategies to enable developing countries to capture the benefits of FDI. He concludes by examining the impact of outward investment on workers and communities in the home economy, investigating evidence about what Ross Perot called the \"great sucking sound,\" and asking whether the expansion of foreign investment in the developing world comes at the expense of good jobs and dynamic industries in the developed countries.</p>"

"<p>Adhesion plays a major role in the bacterial lifestyle. Bacteria can adhere to organic and inorganic surfaces, to each other, and of course to host cells during pathogenesis.\nThe focus of this book is: how are such adhesion phenomena best studied? Microbial genetics experiments have greatly enhanced our knowledge of what bacterial factors are involved in adhesion. For numerous reasons, though, biochemical and structural biology knowledge of the molecular interactions involved in adhesion are limited. One major problem has been a lack of interdisciplinary research and understanding in the field. On the one hand, the microbiologists lack detailed knowledge of the biophysical possibilities and have limited access to the frequently expensive instrumentation involved while on the other hand, the experts in these methods frequently do not have access to the biological materials, nor do they necessarily understand the biological questions to be answered. The purpose of this book is thus to overcome this gap in communication between researchers in biology, chemistry and physics and to display the many ways and means to investigate bacterial adhesion. We hope to stimulate new and ground-breaking research.</p>"

"<p><em>Survival Manual that provides condensation of biostatistical methods that microbiology researchers need to perform data analyses </em>Author has two decades of research and teaching experience and methods rely on use of basic hand-held calculator *Will help ground one's microbiological expertise using biostatistics as a tool Biostatistics and Microbiology enables the reader to access and apply statistical methods that generally frustrate and intimidate the uninitiated. Statistics, like chemistry, microbiology, woodworking, or sewing, requires that the individual put some time into learning the concepts and methods. This book presents a step-by-step manner that eliminates the greatest obstacle to the learner, which is applying the many processes that comprise a statistical method. The author counters the fear of statistical methods by describing early in the book a step-by-step procedure to perform a statistical method - a process that we will term \"the six-step procedure.\" All of the testing will be performed adhering to six well-defined steps, which will greatly simplify the statistical process. Each step in the sequence must be completed before moving on to the next step. In the context of microbiology, statistics can be extremely useful in making interpretations and decisions concerning collected data. Statistics, then, is a way of formally communicating the interpretation of clinical or experimental data and is particularly important when a treatment result is not clearly differentiable from another treatment.

"<div><p>Evolutionary algorithms is a class of randomized heuristics inspired by natural evolution. They are applied in many different contexts, in particular in optimization, and analysis of such algorithms has seen tremendous advances in recent years. </p><p>In this book the author provides an introduction to the methods used to analyze evolutionary algorithms and other randomized search heuristics. He starts with an algorithmic and modular perspective and gives guidelines for the design of evolutionary algorithms. He then places the approach in the broader research context with a chapter on theoretical perspectives. By adopting a complexity-theoretical perspective, he derives general limitations for black-box optimization, yielding lower bounds on the performance of evolutionary algorithms, and then develops general methods for deriving upper and lower bounds step by step. This main part is followed by a chapter covering practical applications of these methods. </p><p>The notational and mathematical basics are covered in an appendix, the results presented are derived in detail, and each chapter ends with detailed comments and pointers to further reading. So the book is a useful reference for both graduate students and researchers engaged with the theoretical analysis of such algorithms.</p></div>"

"<p class=\"description\">Humans have been “manually” extracting patterns from data for centuries, but the increasing volume of data in modern times has called for more automatic approaches. Early methods of identifying patterns in data include Bayes’ theorem (1700s) and Regression analysis (1800s). The proliferation, ubiquity and incre- ing power of computer technology has increased data collection and storage. As data sets have grown in size and complexity, direct hands-on data analysis has increasingly been augmented with indirect, automatic data processing. Data mining has been developed as the tool for extracting hidden patterns from data, by using computing power and applying new techniques and methodologies for knowledge discovery. This has been aided by other discoveries in computer science, such as Neural networks, Clustering, Genetic algorithms (1950s), Decision trees (1960s) and Support vector machines (1980s). Data mining commonlyinvolves four classes of tasks: • Classification: Arranges the data into prede ned groups. For example, an e-mail program might attempt to classify an e-mail as legitimate or spam. Common algorithmsinclude Nearest neighbor,Naive Bayes classi er and Neural network. • Clustering: Is like classification but the groups are not predefined, so the algorithm will try to group similar items together. • Regression: Attempts to find a function which models the data with the least error. A common method is to use Genetic Programming. • Association rule learning: Searches for relationships between variables. For example, a supermarket might gather data of what each customer buys.</p>"
"<div><p>The only comprehensive historical analysis of the globalization of the U.S. apparel industry, this book focuses on the reemergence of sweatshops in the United States and the growth of new ones abroad. Ellen Israel Rosen, who has spent more than a decade investigating the problems of America's domestic apparel workers, now probes the shifts in trade policy and global economics that have spawned momentous changes in the international apparel and textile trade. <em>Making Sweatshops </em>asks whether the process of globalization can be promoted in ways that blend industrialization and economic development in both poor and rich countries with concerns for social and economic justice—especially for the women who toil in the industry's low-wage sites around the world.  </p><p>Rosen looks closely at the role trade policy has played in globalization in this industry. She traces the history of current policies toward the textile and apparel trade to cold war politics and the reconstruction of the Pacific Rim economies after World War II. Her narrative takes us through the rise of protectionism and the subsequent dismantling of trade protection during the Reagan era to the passage of NAFTA and the continued push for trade accords through the WTO. Going beyond purely economic factors, this valuable study elaborates the full historical and political context in which the globalization of textiles and apparel has taken place. Rosen takes a critical look at the promises of prosperity, both in the U.S. and in developing countries, made by advocates for the global expansion of these industries. She offers evidence to suggest that this process may inevitably create new and more extreme forms of poverty.</p></div>"

"<p class=\"description\">Muscle contraction has been the focus of scientific investigation for more than two centuries, and major discoveries have changed the field over the years. Early in the twentieth century, Fenn (1924, 1923) showed that the total energy liberated during a contraction (heat + work) was increased when the muscle was allowed to shorten and perform work. The result implied that chemical reactions during contractions were load-dependent. The observation underlying the “Fenn effect” was taken to a greater extent when Hill (1938) published a pivotal study showing in details the relation between heat production and the amount of muscle shortening, providing investigators with the force-velocity relation for skeletal muscles. Subsequently, two papers paved the way for the current paradigm in the field of muscle contraction. Huxley and Niedergerke (1954), and Huxley and Hanson (1954) showed that the width of the A-bands did not change during muscle stretch or activation. Contraction, previously believed to be caused by shortening of muscle filaments, was associated with sliding of the thick and thin filaments. These studies were followed by the classic paper by Huxley (1957), in which he conceptualized for the first time the cross-bridge theory; filament sliding was driven by the cyclical interactions of myosin heads (cross-bridges) with actin. The original cross-bridge theory has been revised over the years but the basic features have remained mostly intact. It now influences studies performed with molecular motors responsible for tasks as diverse as muscle contraction, cell division and vesicle transport.</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">New textbooks at all levels of chemistry appear with great regularity. Some fields like basic biochemistry, organic reaction mechanisms, and chemical thermodynamics are well represented by many excellent texts, and new or revised editions are published sufficiently often to keep up with progress in research. However, some areas of chemistry, especially many of those taught at the graduate level, suffer from a real lack of up to-date textbooks. The most serious needs occur in fields that are rapidly changing. Textbooks in these subjects usually have to be written by scientists actually involved in the research which is advancing the field. It is not often easy to persuade such individuals so set time aside to help spread the knowledge they have accumulated. Our goal, in this series, is to pinpoint areas of chemistry where recent progress has outpaced what is covered in any available textbooks, and then seek out and persuade experts in these fields to produce relatively concise but instructive intro ductions to their fields. These should serve the needs of one semester or one quarter graduate courses in chemistry and biochemistry. In some cases, the availability of texts in active research areas should help stimulate the creation of new courses. Charles R.

"<p class=\"description\">The rapidly evolving field of protein science has now come to realize the ubiquity and importance of protein-protein interactions. It had been known for some time that proteins may interact with each other to form functional complexes, but it was thought to be the property of only a handful of key proteins. However, with the advent of high throughput proteomics to monitor protein-protein interactions at an organism level, we can now safely state that protein-protein interactions are the norm and not the exception. Thus, protein function must be understood in the larger context of the various binding complexes that each protein may form with interacting partners at a given time in the life cycle of a cell. Proteins are now seen as forming sophisticated interaction networks subject to remarkable regulation. The study of these interaction networks and regulatory mechanism, which I would like to term \"systems proteomics,\" is one of the thriving fields of proteomics. The bird-eye view that systems proteomics offers should not however mask the fact that proteins are each characterized by a unique set of physical and chemical properties. In other words, no protein looks and behaves like another. This complicates enormously the design of high-throughput proteomics methods. Unlike genes, which, by and large, display similar physico-chemical behaviors and thus can be easily used in a high throughput mode, proteins are not easily amenable to the same treatment. It is thus important to remind researchers active in the proteomics field the fundamental basis of protein chemistry. This book attempts to bridge the two extreme ends of protein science: on one end, systems proteomics, which describes, at a system level, the intricate connection network that proteins form in a cell, and on the other end, protein chemistry and biophysics, which describe the molecular properties of individual proteins and the structural and thermodynamic basis of their interactions within the network. Bridging the two ends of the spectrum is bioinformatics and computational chemistry. Large data sets created by systems proteomics need to be mined for meaningful information, methods need to be designed and implemented to improve experimental designs, extract signal over noise, and reject artifacts, and predictive methods need to be worked out and put to the test. Computational chemistry faces similar challenges. The prediction of binding thermodynamics of protein-protein interaction is still in its infancy. Proteins are large objects, and simplifying assumptions and shortcuts still need to be applied to make simulations manageable, and this despite exponential progress in computer technology. Finally, the study of proteins impacts directly on human health. It is an obvious statement to say that, for decades, enzymes, receptors, and key regulator proteins have been targeted for drug discovery. However, a recent and exciting development is the exploitation of our knowledge of protein-protein interaction for the design of new pharmaceuticals. This presents particular challenges because protein-protein interfaces are generally shallow and interactions are weak. However, progress is clearly being made and the book seeks to provide examples of successes in this area.</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">In 1937 Ernest Hemingway traveled to Spain to cover the civil war there for the North American Newspaper Alliance. Three years later he completed the greatest novel to emerge from “the good fight,” For Whom the Bell Tolls. The story of Robert Jordan, a young American in the International Brigades attached to an antifascist guerilla unit in the mountains of Spain, it tells of loyalty and courage, love and defeat, and the tragic death of an ideal. In his portrayal of Jordan’s love for the beautiful Maria and his superb account of El Sordo’s last stand, in his brilliant travesty of La Pasionaria and his unwillingness to believe in blind faith, Hemingway surpasses his achievement in The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell to Arms to create a work at once rare and beautiful, strong and brutal, compassionate, moving, and wise. “If the function of a writer is to reveal reality,” Maxwell Perkins wrote Hemingway after reading the manuscript, “no one ever so completely performed it.” Greater in power, broader in scope, and more intensely emotional than any of the author’s previous works, it stands as one of the best war novels of all time.</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">Visitors call seldom at Blackwood House. Taking tea at the scene of a multiple poisoning, with a suspected murderess as one's host, is a perilous business. For a start, the talk tends to turn to arsenic. \"It happened in this very room, and we still have our dinner in here every night,\" explains Uncle Julian, continually rehearsing the details of the fatal family meal. \"My sister made these this morning,\" says Merricat, politely proffering a plate of rum cakes, fresh from the poisoner's kitchen. We Have Always Lived in the Castle, Shirley Jackson's 1962 novel, is full of a macabre and sinister humor, and Merricat herself, its amiable narrator, is one of the great unhinged heroines of literature. \"What place would be better for us than this?\" she asks, of the neat, secluded realm she shares with her uncle and with her beloved older sister, Constance. \"Who wants us, outside? The world is full of terrible people.\" Merricat has developed an idiosyncratic system of rules and protective magic, burying talismanic objects beneath the family estate, nailing them to trees, ritually revisiting them. She has made \"a powerful taut web which never loosened, but held fast to guard us\" against the distrust and hostility of neighboring villagers.Or so she believes. But at last the magic fails. A stranger arrives -- cousin Charles, with his eye on the Blackwood fortune. He disturbs the sisters' careful habits, installing himself at the head of the family table, unearthing Merricat's treasures, talking privately to Constance about \"normal lives\" and \"boy friends.\" Unable to drive him away by either polite or occult means, Merricat adopts more desperate methods. The result is crisis and tragedy, the revelation of a terrible secret, the convergence of the villagers upon the house, and a spectacular unleashing of collective spite.The sisters are propelled further into seclusion and solipsism, abandoning \"time and the orderly pattern of our old days\" in favor of an ever-narrowing circuit of ritual and shadow. They have themselves become talismans, to be alternately demonized and propitiated, darkly, with gifts. Jackson's novel emerges less as a study in eccentricity and more -- like some of her other fictions -- as a powerful critique of the anxious, ruthless processes involved in the maintenance of normality itself. \"Poor strangers,\" says Merricat contentedly at last, studying trespassers from the darkness behind the barricaded Blackwood windows. \"They have so much to be afraid of.\"</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">Mathematics plays a key role in computer science, some researchers would consider computers as nothing but the physical embodiment of mathematical systems. And whether you are designing a digital circuit, a computer program or a new programming language, you need mathematics to be able to reason about the design -- its correctness, robustness and dependability. This book covers the foundational mathematics necessary for courses in computer science.The common approach to presenting mathematical concepts and operators is to define them in terms of properties they satisfy, and then based on these definitions develop ways of computing the result of applying the operators and prove them correct. This book is mainly written for computer science students, so here the author takes a different approach: he starts by defining ways of calculating the results of applying the operators and then proves that they satisfy various properties. After justifying his underlying approach the author offers detailed chapters covering propositional logic, predicate calculus, sets, relations, discrete structures, structured types, numbers, and reasoning about programs.The book contains chapter and section summaries, detailed proofs and many end-of-section exercises -- key to the learning process. The book is suitable for undergraduate and graduate students, and although the treatment focuses on areas with frequent applications in computer science, the book is also suitable for students of mathematics and engineering.</p>"

"<p>This book is an introduction to game theory from a mathematical perspective. It is intended to be a ?rst course for undergraduate students of mathematics, but I also hope that it will contain something of interest to advanced students or researchers in biology and economics who often encounter the basics of game theory informally via relevant applications. In view of the intended audience, the examples used in this book are generally abstract problems so that the reader is not forced to learn a great deal of a subject either biology or e- nomics that may be unfamiliar. Where a context is given, these are usually classical problems of the subject area and are, I hope, easy enough to follow. The prerequisites are generally modest. Apart from a familiarity with (or a willingness to learn) the concepts of a proof and some mathematical no- tion, the main requirement is an elementary understanding of probability. A familiarity with basic calculus would be useful for Chapter 6 and some parts of Chapters 1 and 8. The basic ideas of simple ordinary di?erential equations are required in Chapter 9 and, towards the end of that chapter, some familiarity with matrices would be an advantage although the relevant ideas are brie?y described in an appendix.\"</p>"

"<p>This book is a detailed description of the basics of three-dimensional digital image processing. A 3D digital image (abbreviated as 3D image below) is a digitalized representation of a 3D object or an entire 3D space, stored in a computer as a 3D array. Whereas normal digital image processing is concerned with screens that are a collection of square shapes called pixels and their corresponding density levels, the image plane in three dimensions is represented by a division into cubical graphical elements (called voxels ) that represent corresponding density levels. Inthecontextofimageprocessing, in manycases3Dimageprocessingwill refer to the input of multiple 2D images and performing processing in order to understand the 3D space (or scene ) that they depict. This is a result of research into how to use input from image sensors such as television cameras as a basis for learning about a 3D scene, thereby replicating the sense of vision for humans or intelligent robots, and this has been the central problem in image processing research since the 1970s. However, a completely di?erent type of image with its own new problems, the 3D digital image discussed in this book, rapidly took prominence in the 1980s, particularly in the ?eld of medical imaging. These were recordings of human bodies obtained through computed (or computerized ) tomography (CT), imagesthatrecordednotonlytheexternal, visiblesurfaceofthesubject but also, to some degree of resolution, its internal structure.

"<div><p>Since Darwin's day, we've been told that sexual monogamy comes naturally to our species. Mainstream science--as well as religious and cultural institutions--has maintained that men and women evolved in families in which a man's possessions and protection were exchanged for a woman's fertility and fidelity. But this narrative is collapsing. Fewer and fewer couples are getting married, and divorce rates keep climbing as adultery and flagging libido drag down even seemingly solid marriages.  </p>\n<p>How can reality be reconciled with the accepted narrative? It can't be, according to renegade thinkers Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jethá. While debunking almost everything we \"know\" about sex, they offer a bold alternative explanation in this provocative and brilliant book.  </p>\n<p>Ryan and Jethá's central contention is that human beings evolved in egalitarian groups that shared food, child care, and, often, sexual partners. Weaving together convergent, frequently overlooked evidence from anthropology, archaeology, primatology, anatomy, and psychosexuality, the authors show how far from human nature monogamy really is. Human beings everywhere and in every era have confronted the same familiar, intimate situations in surprisingly different ways. The authors expose the ancient roots of human sexuality while pointing toward a more optimistic future illuminated by our innate capacities for love, cooperation, and generosity.  </p>\n<p>With intelligence, humor, and wonder, Ryan and Jethá show how our promiscuous past haunts our struggles over monogamy, sexual orientation, and family dynamics. They explore why long-term fidelity can be so difficult for so many; why sexual passion tends to fade even as love deepens; why many middle-aged men risk everything for transient affairs with younger women; why homosexuality persists in the face of standard evolutionary logic; and what the human body reveals about the prehistoric origins of modern sexuality.  </p>\n<p>In the tradition of the best historical and scientific writing, <em>Sex at Dawn</em> unapologetically upends unwarranted assumptions and unfounded conclusions while offering a revolutionary understanding of why we live and love as we do.</p></div>"

"<p class=\"description\">In the field of molecular evolution, inferences about past evolutionary events are made using molecular data from currently living species. With the availability of genomic data from multiple related species, molecular evolution has become one of the most active and fastest growing fields of study in genomics and bioinformatics. Most studies in molecular evolution rely heavily on statistical procedures based on stochastic process modelling and advanced computational methods including high-dimensional numerical optimization and Markov Chain Monte Carlo. This book provides an overview of the statistical theory and methods used in studies of molecular evolution. It includes an introductory section suitable for readers that are new to the field, a section discussing practical methods for data analysis, and more specialized sections discussing specific models and addressing statistical issues relating to estimation and model choice. The chapters are written by the leaders of field and they will take the reader from basic introductory material to the state-of-the-art statistical methods. This book is suitable for statisticians seeking to learn more about applications in molecular evolution and molecular evolutionary biologists with an interest in learning more about the theory behind the statistical methods applied in the field. The chapters of the book assume no advanced mathematical skills beyond basic calculus, although familiarity with basic probability theory will help the reader. Most relevant statistical concepts are introduced in the book in the context of their application in molecular evolution, and the book should be accessible for most biology graduate students with an interest in quantitative methods and theory. Rasmus Nielsen received his Ph.D. form the University of California at Berkeley in 1998 and after a postdoc at Harvard University, he assumed a faculty position in Statistical Genomics at Cornell University. He is currently an Ole R�mer Fellow at the University of Copenhagen and holds a Sloan Research Fellowship. His is an associate editor of the Journal of Molecular Evolution and has published more than fifty original papers in peer-reviewed journals on the topic of this book. From the reviews: \"...Overall this is a very useful book in an area of increasing importance.\" Journal of the Royal Statistical Society \"I find Statistical Methods in Molecular Evolution very interesting and useful. It delves into problems that were considered very difficult just several years ago...the book is likely to stimulate the interest of statisticians that are unaware of this exciting field of applications. It is my hope that it will also help the 'wet lab' molecular evolutionist to better understand mathematical and statistical methods.\" Marek Kimmel for the Journal of the American Statistical Association, September 2006 \"Who should read this book? We suggest that anyone who deals with molecular data (who does not?) and anyone who asks evolutionary questions (who should not?) ought to consult the relevant chapters in this book.\" Dan Graur and Dror Berel for Biometrics, September 2006 \"Coalescence theory facilitates the merger of population genetics theory with phylogenetic approaches, but still, there are mostly two camps: phylogeneticists and population geneticists. Only a few people are moving freely between them. Rasmus Nielsen is certainly one of these researchers, and his work so far has merged many population genetic and phylogenetic aspects of biological research under the umbrella of molecular evolution. Although Nielsen did not contribute a chapter to his book, his work permeates all its chapters. This book gives an overview of his interests and current achievements in molecular evolution. In short, this book should be on your bookshelf.\" Peter Beerli for Evolution, 60(2), 2006</p>"

"<p>In the early days of computer science, the interactions of hardware, software, compilers, and operating system were simple enough to allow students to see an overall picture of how computers worked. With the increasing complexity of computer technology and the resulting specialization of knowledge, such clarity is often lost. Unlike other texts that cover only one aspect of the field, \"The Elements of Computing Systems\" gives students an integrated and rigorous picture of applied computer science, as its comes to play in the construction of a simple yet powerful computer system. Indeed, the best way to understand how computers work is to build one from scratch, and this textbook leads students through twelve chapters and projects that gradually build a basic hardware platform and a modern software hierarchy from the ground up. In the process, the students gain hands-on knowledge of hardware architecture, operating systems, programming languages, compilers, data structures, algorithms, and software engineering. Using this constructive approach, the book exposes a significant body of computer science knowledge and demonstrates how theoretical and applied techniques taught in other courses fit into the overall picture. Designed to support one- or two-semester courses, the book is based on an abstraction-implementation paradigm; each chapter presents a key hardware or software abstraction, a proposed implementation that makes it concrete, and an actual project. The emerging computer system can be built by following the chapters, although this is only one option, since the projects are self-contained and can be done or skipped in any order. All the computer science knowledge necessary for completing the projects is embedded in the book, the only pre-requisite being a programming experience. The book's web site provides all tools and materials necessary to build all the hardware and software systems described in the text, including two hundred test programs for the twelve projects. The projects and systems can be modified to meet various teaching needs, and all the supplied software is open-source.</p>"

"<div><p>First published in 1985, The Handmaid's Tale is a novel of such power that the reader is unable to forget its images and its forecast. With more than two million copies in print, it is Margaret Atwood's most popular and compelling novel.Set in the near future, it describes life in what once was the United States, now called the Republic of Gilead. Reacting to social unrest, and a sharply declining birthrate, the new regime has reverted to -- even gone beyond -- the repressive tolerance of the original Puritans. Offred is a Handmaid who may leave the home of the Commander and his wife once a day to walk to food markets whose signs are now pictures instead of words because women are no longer allowed to read.

"<div><p>This innovative study presents concepts and problems in soil physics, and provides solutions using original computer programs. It provides a close examination of physical environments of soil, including an analysis of the movement of heat, water and gases. The authors employ the programming language Python, which is now widely used for numerical problem solving in the sciences. In contrast to the majority of the literature on soil physics, this text focuses on<br>\nsolving, not deriving, differential equations for transport. Using numerical procedures to solve differential equations allows the solution of quite difficult problems with fairly simple mathematical tools. Numerical methods convert differential into algebraic equations, which can be solved using<br>\nconventional methods of linear algebra. Each chapter introduces a soil physics concept, and proceeds to develop computer programs to solve the equations and illustrate the points made in the discussion.  </p>\n<p>Problems at the end of each chapter help the reader practise using the concepts introduced. The text is suitable for advanced undergraduates, graduates and researchers of soil physics. It employs an open source philosophy where computer code is presented, explained and discussed, and provides the reader with a full understanding of the solutions. Once mastered, the code can be adapted and expanded for the user's own models, fostering further developments. The Python tools provide a simple<br>\nsyntax, Object Oriented Programming techniques, powerful mathematical and numerical tools, and a user friendly environment.</p></div>"

"<p class=\"description\">As a child, Kathy - now thirty-one years old - lived at Hailsham, a private school in the scenic English countryside where the children were sheltered from the outside world, brought up to believe that they were special and that their well-being was crucial not only for themselves but for the society they would eventually enter. Kathy had long ago put this idyllic past behind her, but when two of her Hailsham friends come back into her life, she stops resisting the pull of memory. And so, as her friendship with Ruth is rekindled, and as the feelings that long ago fueled her adolescent crush on Tommy begin to deepen into love, Kathy recalls their years at Hailsham. She describes happy scenes of boys and girls growing up together, unperturbed - even comforted - by their isolation. But she describes other scenes as well; of discord and misunderstanding that hint at a dark secret behind Hailsham’s nurturing facade. With the dawning clarity of hindsight, the three friends are compelled to face the truth about their childhood - and about their lives now.</p>"
"<p>Until recently digital processing of biomedical images was conducted solely in the research laboratories of the universities and industry. However, with the advent of computerized tomography in 1972 and the computerized white blood cell differential count in 1974, enormous changes have suddenly occurred. Digital image pro cessing in biomedicine has now become the most active sector in the digital image processing field. Processing rates have reached the level of one trillion picture elements per year in the United States alone and are expected to be ten trillion per year in 1980. This enormous volume of activity has stimulated further re search in biomedical image processing in the last two years with the result that important inroads have been made in applications in radiology, oncology, and ophthalmology. Although much significant work in this field is taking place in Europe, it is in the United States and Japan that the level of activity is highest.\"</p>"
"<p class=\"description\">Cryoelectron microscopy of biological molecules is among the hottest growth areas in biophysics and structural biology at present, and Frank is arguably the most distinguished practitioner of this art. CryoEM is likely over the next few years to take over much of the structural approaches currently requiring X-ray crystallography, because one can now get good and finely detailed images of single molecules down to as little as 200,000 MW, covering a substantial share of the molecules of greatest biomedical research interest. This book, the successor to an earlier work published in 1996 with Academic Press, is a natural companion work to our forthcoming book on electron crystallography by Robert Glaeser, with contributions by six others, including Frank. A growing number of workers will employ CryoEM for structural studies in their own research, and a large proportion of biomedical researchers will have a growing interest in understanding what the capabilities and limits of this approach are.</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">During the past decade there has been a great increase in the use of protective groups, especially in the synthesis of large and complex organic molecules. Perhaps the greatest activity has been in the peptide field where such triumphs as the total synthesis of insulin and of bovine ribonuclease (molecular weight 13,700) have been achieved. Correspondingly, more protective groups have been devised for the protection of amino and imino groups than for any other functional group. There are many reviews and books on the synthesis of pep tides but there has been no general survey of protective groups since my 1 own review in 1963. At that time the five main methods for the removal of protective groups involved acid or base hydroly sis, reduction, oxidation, or thermal elimination reactions. Recent advances include the use of photo-sensitive and metal ion sensitive protective groups, and the attachment of functional groups to reactive polymers as a method of protec tion during the solid-phase synthesis of peptides and poly nucleotides. Another interesting development is the design and use of protective groups with a built-in 'safety-catch', which can be 'released' by a specific chemical reaction, so that an otherwise stable bond is made labile at the appropriate moment thereby allowing the protective group to be removed under very 2 mild conditions. My own interest in protective groups dates from 1944 when, as a student, I gave two lectures on the subject and produced an 11 page review including 70 references.</p>"

"<div><p><em>Necrophilia Variations</em> is a literary monograph on the erotic attraction to corpses and death. It consists of a series of texts that, like musical phrases, take up the theme and advance it by means of repetition, contrast, and variation. To love someone dead is merely nostalgia, but to make love with someone dead is necrophilia, and this book is about that.  </p>\n<p>Although a work of fiction, <em>Necrophilia Variations</em> uses literary means to probe the psychopathology of sexual perversion. Eros, the book asks, is naturally drawn to beauty, and yet nothing would seem to be less inherently beautiful than a cadaver. How is it that a necrophile ends up confusing the two, or making the leap, such that he finds beauty in what most people would find repugnant? How does he come to desire that which would seem to be intrinsically undesirable?  </p>\n<p>Written in a style that ranges from the lugubrious to the ludicrous — from purple prose to black humor — <em>Necrophilia Variations</em> exhibits a world of depravity from the inside out. Each of its texts utilizes the first person — not because it is autobiographical but rather because it is personal, even intimate. Why intimate? Because that's how death is — near you, beside you, eventually inside you as well. It would be nice to say that that's how sex is too — intimate — but then it's no secret just how impersonal sex can be, especially when your lover is unconscious or worse.  </p>\n<p>If you have ever contemplated the curious points of contact between eros and thanatos — if you have ever wondered why femmes fatales are alluring, or why sex can be made more exciting by games that simulate danger and pain, or why that bit of French slang that deems orgasm a \"little death\" seems so appropriate — then you may well enjoy this book. And if you do, then your joy in reading may even unlock the necrophiliac mind for you — since a text is, like a corpse, the remains of a living being, and as a reader you will no doubt be determined to extract pleasure from it.</p></div>"

"<p class=\"description\">The Purpose of This Text This text has been written in response to two trends that have gained considerable momentum over the past few years. The first is the decision by many undergraduate engineering and science departments to abandon the traditional programming course based on the aging Fortran 77 standard. This decision is not surprise. This text teaches the essentials of C programming, concentrating on what readers need to know in order to produce stand-alone programs and so solve typical scientific and engineering problems. It is a learning-by-doing book, with many examples and exercises, and lays a foundation of scientific programming concepts and techniques that will prove valuable for those who might eventually move on to another language. Written for undergraduates who are familiar with computers and typical applications but are new to programming.ing, considering the more modem features found in languages such as Pascal and C. However, Pascal never developed a strong following in scientific computing, and its use is in decline. The new Fortran 90 standard defines a powerful, modem language, but this long-overdue redesign of Fortran has come too late to prevent many colleges and universities from switching to C. The acceptance of C by scientists and engineers is based perhaps as. much on their perceptions of C as an important language, which it certainly is, and on C programming experience as a highly marketable skill, as it is on the suitability of C for scientific computation. For whatever reason, C or its derivative C++ is now widely taught as the first and often only programming language for undergraduates in science and engineering. The second trend is the evolving nature of the undergraduate engineering curriculum. At a growing number of institutions, the traditional approach of stressing theory and mathematics fundamentals in the early undergraduate years, and postponing real engineering applications until later in the curriculum, has been turned upside down.</p>"
"<p class=\"description\">Dale's Principle postulated that a neuron functions as a metabolic unit, whereby a process occurring in the cell can influence all of the compartments of that given neuron. This was unfortunately transformed in the literature to a principle stating that “a single cell releases only one neurotransmitter”. Until recently, this has influenced many neuroscientists to consider with skepticism the idea that classical neurotransmitters could be co-released from neurons. It is now clear that the “one neuron, one neurotransmitter” postulate is the exception rather than the rule. The aim of this book is to gather the available evidence, provided by the authors that have discovered and studied the co-existence or co-release of several pairs of neurotransmitters, in several neural networks. It will provide a timely overview of a mechanism of neural communication that is likely to attract increasing attention of the neuroscientific community.</p>"

"<p>Thermodynamics was created in the first half of the 19th century as a theory designed to explain the functioning of heat engines converting heat into mechanical work. In the course of time, while the scope of research in this field was being extended to a wider and wider class of energy transformations, thermodynamics came to be considered as a general theory of machines identi?ed with energy transducers. Important progress in biochemistry in the first half of the 20th century, and in molecular biology in the second half, made it possible to think of treating even living organisms as machines, at least on the subcellular level. However, success in applying thermodynamics to elucidate the phenomenon of life has been rather mitigated. Two reasons seem to be responsible for this unsatisfactory situation. Nineteenth century thermodynamics dealt only with simple (homogeneous) systems in complete equilibrium. Although during the 20th century a nonequilibrium thermodynamics was developed, starting with the Onsager theory of linear response and ending with the Prigogine nonlinear theory of dissipative structures, these theories still concern the originally homogeneous systems. Because living organisms are complex systems with a historically frozen spatial and functional structure, a thermodynamics of both nonequilibrium and complex systems is needed for their description. The first goal of the present book is to formulate the foundations of such a thermodynamics.</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">The book of nature is written in the language of mathematics  -- Galileo Galilei How is it possible to predict weather patterns for tomorrow, with access solely to today’s weather data? And how is it possible to predict the aerodynamic behavior of an aircraft that has yet to be built? The answer is computer simulations based on mathematical models – sets of equations – that describe the underlying physical properties. However, these equations are usually much too complicated to solve, either by the smartest mathematician or the largest supercomputer. This problem is overcome by constructing an approximation: a numerical model with a simpler structure can be translated into a program that tells the computer how to carry out the simulation.This book conveys the fundamentals of mathematical models, numerical methods and algorithms. Opening with a tutorial on mathematical models and analysis, it proceeds to introduce the most important classes of numerical methods, with finite element, finite difference and spectral methods as central tools. The concluding section describes applications in physics and engineering, including wave propagation, heat conduction and fluid dynamics. Also covered are the principles of computers and programming, including MATLAB®.</p>"
"<p class=\"description\">The book serves as a first introduction to computer programming of scientific applications, using the high-level Python language.

By blending programming, mathematics and scientific applications, the book lays a solid foundation for practicing computational science. From the reviews: Langtangen... does an excellent job of introducing programming as a set of skills in problem solving. He guides the reader into thinking properly about producing program logic and data structures for modeling real-world problems using objects and functions and embracing the object-oriented paradigm.... Summing Up: Highly recommended. F. H.

"<p>This book gives a good introduction to evolutionary computation for those who are first entering the field and are looking for insight into the underlying mechanisms behind them. Emphasizing the scientific and machine learning applications of genetic algorithms instead of applications to optimization and engineering, the book could serve well in an actual course on adaptive algorithms. The authors include excellent problem sets, these being divided up into \"thought exercises\" and \"computer exercises\" in genetic algorithm. Practical use of genetic algorithms demands an understanding of how to implement them, and the authors do so in the last two chapters of the book by giving the applications in various fields. This book also outlines some ideas on when genetic algorithms and genetic programming should be used, and this is useful since a newcomer to the field may be tempted to view a genetic algorithm as merely a fancy Monte Carlo simulation. The most difficult part of using a genetic algorithm is how to encode the population, and the authors discuss various ways to do this. Various \"exotic\" approaches to improve the performance of genetic algorithms are also discussed such as the \"messy\" genetic algorithms, adaptive genetic algorithm and hybrid genetic algorithm. </p>"

Those familiar with Gaylord's previous book, coauthored with Paul Wellin, \"Computer Simulations with Mathematica - Explorations in Complex Biological and Physical Systems,\" also published by TELOS, will find this new title to be an in-depth extension of some topics dealt with in that book. Modeling Nature: Cellular Automata Simulations with Mathematica, however, contains simulations not found in the Gaylord-Wellin volume. This book will have a DOS-diskette packaged with it, enabling cross-platform access to the code. These data files will also be made accessible online via the Internet at telospub.com FTP and WWW sites.</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">The masochist, the voyeur, the sadist, the sodomite, the fetishist, the pedophile, and the necrophiliac all expose hidden but essential elements of the social relation. Arguing that the concept of perversion, usually stigmatized, ought rather to be understood as a necessary stage in the development of all non-psychotic subjects, the essays in Perversion and the Social Relation consider the usefulness of the category of the perverse for exploring how social relations are formed, maintained, and transformed.By focusing on perversion as a psychic structure rather than as aberrant behavior, the contributors provide an alternative to models of social interpretation based on classical Oedipal models of maturation and desire. At the same time, they critique claims that the perverse is necessarily subversive or liberating. In their lucid introduction, the editors explain that while fixation at the stage of the perverse can result in considerable suffering for the individual and others, perversion motivates social relations by providing pleasure and fulfilling the psychological need to put something in the place of the Father. The contributors draw on a variety of psychoanalytic perspectives—Freudian and Lacanian—as well as anthropology, history, literature, and film. From Slavoj Žižek's meditation on “the politics of masochism” in David Fincher's movie Fight Club through readings of works including William Styron's The Confessions of Nat Turner, Don DeLillo's White Noise, and William Burroughs's Cities of the Red Night, the essays collected here illuminate perversion's necessary role in social relations.

"<p class=\"description\">In May 2013, Glenn Greenwald set out for Hong Kong to meet an anonymous source who claimed to have astonishing evidence of pervasive government spying and insisted on communicating only through heavily encrypted channels. That source turned out to be the 29-year-old NSA contractor and whistleblower Edward Snowden, and his revelations about the agency's widespread, systemic overreach proved to be some of the most explosive and consequential news in recent history, triggering a fierce debate over national security and information privacy. As the arguments rage on and the government considers various proposals for reform, it is clear that we have yet to see the full impact of Snowden's disclosures.Now for the first time, Greenwald fits all the pieces together, recounting his high-intensity ten-day trip to Hong Kong, examining the broader implications of the surveillance detailed in his reporting for The Guardian, and revealing fresh information on the NSA's unprecedented abuse of power with never-before-seen documents entrusted to him by Snowden himself.Going beyond NSA specifics, Greenwald also takes on the establishment media, excoriating their habitual avoidance of adversarial reporting on the government and their failure to serve the interests of the people. Finally, he asks what it means both for individuals and for a nation's political health when a government pries so invasively into the private lives of its citizens—and considers what safeguards and forms of oversight are necessary to protect democracy in the digital age. Coming at a landmark moment in American history, No Place to Hide is a fearless, incisive, and essential contribution to our understanding of the U.S. surveillance state.</p>"

"<p>Navigate the complexities of biochemical thermodynamics with Mathematica. Chemical reactions are studied under the constraints of constant temperature and constant pressure; biochemical reactions are studied under the additional constraints of pH and, perhaps, pMg or free concentrations of other metal ions. As more intensive variables are specified, more thermodynamic properties of a system are defined, and the equations that represent thermodynamic properties as a function of independent variables become more complicated. <br>\nThis sequel to Robert Alberty's popular Thermodynamics of Biochemical Reactions describes how researchers will find Mathematica(r) a simple and elegant tool, which makes it possible to perform complex calculations that would previously have been impractical.

"<p>As we were at pains to point out in the companion volume to this monograph, entitled Complexity in Chemistry: Introduction and Fundamentals, complexity is to be encountered just about everywhere. All that is needed for us to see it is a suitably trained eye and it then appears almost magically in all manner of guises. Because of its ubiquity, complexity has been and currently still is being defined in a number of differen tways. Some of these definitions have led us to major and powerful new insights. Thus, even in the present monograph, the important distinction is drawn between the interpretations of the concepts of complexity and complication and this is shown to have a signicant bearing on how systems are modeled. Having said this, however, we should not fail to mention that the broad consensus that now gained acceptance is that all of the definitions of complexity are in the last analysis to be understood in essentially intuitive terms. Such definitions will therefore always have a certain degree of fuzziness associated with them. But this latter desideratum should in no way be viewed as diminishing the great usefulness of the concept in any of the many scientific disciplines to which it can be applied. In the chapters that are included in this monograph the fact that differing concepts of complexity can be utilized in a variety of disciplines is made explicit. The specific disciplines that we embrace herein are chemistry, biochemistry, biology, and ecology. Chapter 1, On the Complexity of Fullerenes and Nanotubes, is written by an international team of scientists led by Milan Randic.</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">Covering the major topics of evolutionary game theory, Game-Theoretical Models in Biology presents both abstract and practical mathematical models of real biological situations. It discusses the static aspects of game theory in a mathematically rigorous way that is appealing to mathematicians. In addition, the authors explore many applications of game theory to biology, making the text useful to biologists as well.  The book describes a wide range of topics in evolutionary games, including matrix games, replicator dynamics, the hawk-dove game, and the prisoner’s dilemma. It covers the evolutionarily stable strategy, a key concept in biological games, and offers in-depth details of the mathematical models. Most chapters illustrate how to use MATLAB® to solve various games.   Important biological phenomena, such as the sex ratio of so many species being close to a half, the evolution of cooperative behavior, and the existence of adornments (for example, the peacock’s tail), have been explained using ideas underpinned by game theoretical modeling. Suitable for readers studying and working at the interface of mathematics and the life sciences, this book shows how evolutionary game theory is used in the modeling of these diverse biological phenomena.</p>"
"<div><p>Bill Gates recently told Wired that if he were a teenager today, he would be hacking biology. \"If you want to change the world in some big way,\" he says, \"that's where you should start-biological molecules.\"   </p>\n<p>The most disruptive force on the planet resides in DNA. Biotech companies and academic researchers are just beginning to unlock the potential of piecing together life from scratch. Champions of synthetic biology believe that turning genetic code into Lego-like blocks to build never-before-seen organisms could solve the thorniest challenges in medicine, energy, and environmental protection. But as the hackers who cracked open the potential of the personal computer and the Internet proved, the most revolutionary discoveries often emerge from out-of-the-way places, forged by brilliant outsiders with few resources besides boundless energy and great ideas.   </p>\n<p>In <em>Biopunk</em>, Marcus Wohlsen chronicles a growing community of DIY scientists working outside the walls of corporations and universities who are committed to democratizing DNA the way the Internet did information. The \"biohacking\" movement, now in its early, heady days, aims to unleash an outbreak of genetically modified innovation by making the tools and techniques of biotechnology accessible to everyone. Borrowing their idealism from the worlds of open-source software, artisinal food, Internet startups, and the Peace Corps, biopunks are devoted advocates for open-sourcing the basic code of life.

"<div><br>\nThis book is based on the proposition that very few people actually want\n to learn to program. However, most educated people want to use a \ncomputer, and the task that they most want to do with a computer is \ncommunicate. Alan Perlis first made the claim in 1961 that computer \nscience, and programming explicitly, should be part of a liberal \neducation [Greenberger, 1962]. However, what we've learned since then is\n that one doesn't just \"learn to program.\" One learns to program \nsomething [Adelson and Soloway, 1985, Harel and Papert, 1990], and the \nmotivation to do that something can make the difference between learning\n to program or not [Bruckman, 2000].<br>\n<br>\nThe philosophies which drive the structure of this book include:<br>\n<br>\n- People learn concrete to abstract, driven by need. Teaching structure \nbefore content is painful and results in brittle knowledge that can't be\n used elsewhere [Bruer, 1993]. Certainly, one can introduce structure \n(and theory and design), but students won't really understand the \nstructure until they have the content to fill it with – and a reason to \nneed the structure. Thus, this book doesn't introduce debugging or \ndesign (or complexity or most of computer science) until the students \nare doing complex enough software to make it worthwhile learning.<br>\n<br>\n- Repetition is good. Variety is good. MarvinMinsky once said, \"If you \nknow something only one way, you don't know it at all.\" The same ideas \ncome back frequently in this book. The same idea is framed in multiple \nways. I will use metaphor, visualizations, mathematics, and even \ncomputer science to express ideas in enough different ways that one of \nthe ways will ring true for the individual student.<br>\n<br>\n- The computer is the most amazingly creative device that humans have \never conceived of. It is literally completely made up of mind-stuff. As \nthe movie says, \"Don't just dream it, be it.\" If you can imagine it, you\n can make it \"real\" on the computer. Playing with programming can be and\n should be enormous fun.</div>"

"<p class=\"description\">Dynamic Systems Biology Modeling and Simuation consolidates and unifies classical and contemporary multiscale methodologies for mathematical modeling and computer simulation of dynamic biological systems - from molecular/cellular, organ-system, on up to population levels.  The book pedagogy is developed as a well-annotated, systematic tutorial - with clearly spelled-out and unified nomenclature - derived from the author's own modeling efforts, publications and teaching over half a century.  Ambiguities in some concepts and tools are clarified and others are rendered more accessible and practical.  The latter include novel qualitative theory and methodologies for recognizing dynamical signatures in data using structural (multicompartmental and network) models and graph theory; and analyzing structural and measurement (data) models for quantification feasibility.  The level is basic-to-intermediate, with much emphasis on biomodeling from real biodata, for use in real applications. Introductory coverage of core mathematical concepts such as linear and nonlinear differential and difference equations, Laplace transforms, linear algebra, probability, statistics and stochastics topics; PLUS ...The pertinent biology, biochemistry, biophysics or pharmacology for modeling are provided, to support understanding the amalgam of \"math modeling\" with life sciences.Strong emphasis on quantifying as well as building and analyzing biomodels: includes methodology and computational tools for parameter identifiability and sensitivity analysis; parameter estimation from real data; model distinguishability and simplification; and practical bioexperiment design and optimization.Companion website provides solutions and program code for examples and exercises using Matlab, Simulink, VisSim, SimBiology, SAAMII, AMIGO, Copasi and SBML-coded models.A full set of PowerPoint slides are available from the author for teaching from his textbook.  He uses them to teach a 10 week quarter upper division course at UCLA, which meets twice a week, so there are 20 lectures. They can easily be augmented or stretched for a 15 week semester course.  Importantly, the slides are editable, so they can be readily adapted to a lecturer's personal style and course content needs.  The lectures are based on excerpts from 12 of the first 13 chapters of DSBMS. They are designed to highlight the key course material, as a study guide and structure for students following the full text content. The complete PowerPoint slide package (~25 MB) can be obtained by instructors (or prospective instructors) by emailing the author directly, at: joed@cs.ucla.edu</p>"

"<p>One can say that the field of computational neuroscience started with the 1952 paper of Hodgkin and Huxley in which they describe, through nonlinear partial differential equations, the genesis of the action potential in the giant axon of the squid. These equations and the methods that arose from this combination of modeling and experiments have since formed the basis for nearly every subsequent model for active cells. The Hodgkin Huxley model and a host of simplified equations that are derived from it have inspired the development of new and beautiful mathematics. Dynamical systems and computational methods are now being used to study activity patterns in a variety of neuronal systems. It is becoming increasingly recognized, by both experimentalists and theoreticians, that issues raised in neuroscience and the ma- ematical analysis of neuronal models provide unique interdisciplinary collaborative research and educational opportunities. This book is motivated by a perceived need for an overview of how dynamical systems and computational analysis have been used in understanding the types of models that come out of neuroscience. Our hope is that this will help to stimulate an increasing number of collaborations between mathematicians and other th- reticians, looking for interesting and relevant problems in applied mathematics and dynamical systems, and neuroscientists, looking for new ways to think about the biological mechanisms underlying experimental data. The book arose out of several courses that the authors have taught. One of these is a graduate course in computational neuroscience that has students from the d- ciplines of psychology, mathematics, computer science, physics, and neuroscience.</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">Enzyme kinetics, binding kinetics and pharmacological dose-response curves are currently analyzed by a few standard methods. Some of these, like Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics, use plausible approximations, others, like Hill equations for dose-response curves, are outdated.

This textbook will give a step-by-step introduction to numerical solutions of non-linear and differential equations. It will be accompanied with a set of programs to calculate any reaction scheme on any personal computer. Typical examples from analytical biochemistry and pharmacology can be used as versatile templates. When a reaction scheme is applied for data fitting, the resulting parameters may not be unique.

"<p class=\"description\">The purpose of this book is to provide the reader with a comprehensive introduction to the applications of symmetry analysis to ordinary and partial differential equations. The theoretical background of physics is illustrated by modem methods of computer algebra. The presentation of the material in the book is based on Mathematica 3.0 note books. The entire printed version of this book is available on the accompanying CD. The text is presented in such a way that the reader can interact with the calculations and experiment with the models and methods. Also contained on the CD is a package called MathLie-in honor of Sophus Lie---carrying out the calculations automatically. The application of symmetry analysis to problems from physics, mathematics, and en gineering is demonstrated by many examples. The study of symmetries of differential equations is an old subject. Thanks to Sophus Lie we today have available to us important information on the behavior of differential equations. Symmetries can be used to find exact solutions. Symmetries can be applied to verify and to develop numerical schemes. They can provide conservation laws for differential equations. The theory presented here is based on Lie, containing improve ments and generalizations made by later mathematicians who rediscovered and used Lie's work. The presentation of Lie's theory in connection with Mathematica is novel and vitalizes an old theory. The extensive symbolic calculations necessary under Lie's theory are supported by MathLie, a package written in Mathematica.</p>"

"<p>Since its inception, Git has attracted skilled developers due to its robust, powerful, and reliable features. Its incredibly fast branching ability transformed a piece of code from a niche tool for former Linux Kernel developers into a mainstream distributed versioning system. Like most powerful tools, Git can be hard to approach since it has a lot of commands, subcommands, and options that easily confuse newcomers. The main purpose of Git Essentials is to help you overcome this fear and become adept at all basic tasks in Git. This book starts with an introduction to version control systems, and after this you'll delve deeply into the essentials of Git.

"<div><p>This book is not for professional hackers. Instead, this book is made for beginners who have programming experience and are interested in hacking. Here, hacking techniques that can be easily understood have been described. <strong>If you only have a home PC, you can test all the examples provided here.</strong> I have included many figures that are intuitively understandable rather than a litany of explanations. Therefore, it is possible to gain some practical experience while hacking, since I have only used examples that can actually be implemented. This book is therefore necessary for ordinary people who have a curiosity of hackers and are interested in computers.</p>\n<p>Organization of the Book <br>\nThis book is made up of five major parts, from basic knowledge to actual hacking code. A beginner is naturally expected to become a hacker while reading this book.   </p>\n<p><em>Hacking Preparation</em> <br>\nBriefly introduce the basic Python syntax that is necessary for hacking.   </p>\n<p><em>Application Hacking</em> <br>\nIntroduce the basic skills to hack an application, such as Keyboard hooking, API hooking and image file hacking.   </p>\n<p><em>Web Hacking</em> <br>\nThe Virtual Box test environment configuration is used for a Web Shell attack to introduce web hacking, which is currently an important issue. The techniques include SQL Injection, Password Cracking, and a Web Shell Attack.   </p>\n<p><em>Network Hacking</em> <br>\nA variety of tools and the Python language can be combined to support network hacking and to introduce the network hacking technique. Briefly, we introduce NMap with the Wireshark tool, and hacking techniques such as Port Scanning, Packet Sniffing, TCP SYN Flood, Slowris Attack are introduced.   </p>\n<p><em>System Hacking</em> <br>\nSystem hacking is difficult to understand for beginners, and in this section, figures are used to introduce difficult concepts. The hacking techniques that are introduced include a Backdoor, Registry Handling, Stack Based Buffer Overflow, and SEH Based Buffer Overflow.   </p>\n<p>While reading this book, it is possible to obtain answers for such problems one by one. <br>\nAfter reading the last chapter, you will gain the confidence to be a hacker.   </p>\n<p>Features of this book <br>\nWhen you start to study hacking, the most difficult task is to configure the test environment. <br>\nThere are many problems that need to be addressed, such as choosing from the variety in operating systems, obtaining expensive equipment and using complex technology. Such problems are too difficult to take in at once, so this book overcomes this difficulty by implementing a simple idea.   </p>\n<p>First, <strong>systems will be described as Windows-based</strong>. We are very familiar with Windows, so it is very easy to understand a description based on Windows. Since Windows, Linux, Unix, and Android are all operating systems, it is possible to expand the concepts that are discussed here.   </p>\n<p>Second, <strong>we use a virtual machine called Virtual Box</strong>. For hacking, it is necessary to connect at least three or more computers on a network. Since it is a significant investment to buy a few computers only to study these techniques, a virtual machine can be used instead to easily implement a honeypot necessary to hack by creating multiple virtual machines on a single PC.   </p>\n<p>Finally, <strong>abstract concepts are explained using figures</strong>. </p></div>"

"<div><p>Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole-a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code.  </p>\n<p>Considered <em>the</em> JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables.  </p>\n<p>When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In <em>JavaScript: The Good Parts</em>, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including:  </p>\n<p>Syntax Objects Functions Inheritance Arrays Regular expressions Methods Style Beautiful features The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to <em>unlearn</em> all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book.  </p>\n<p>With <em>JavaScript: The Good Parts</em>, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast.

"<p class=\"description\">\"Even the smartest among us can feel inept as we fail to figure out which light switch or oven burner to turn on, or whether to push, pull, or slide a door. The fault, argues this ingenious-even liberating-book, lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the principles of cognitive psychology. The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization. The Design of Everyday Things shows that good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time. In this entertaining and insightful analysis, cognitive scientist Don Norman hails excellence of design as the most important key to regaining the competitive edge in influencing consumer behavior.

"<p>Winner of the 2014 Jolt Award for \"Best Book\" \"Whether you are an experienced programmer or are starting your career, Python in Practice is full of valuable advice and example to help you improve your craft by thinking about problems from different perspectives, introducing tools, and detailing techniques to create more effective solutions.\" -Doug Hellmann, Senior Developer, DreamHost If you're an experienced Python programmer, Python in Practice will help you improve the quality, reliability, speed, maintainability, and usability of all your Python programs. Mark Summerfield focuses on four key themes: design patterns for coding elegance, faster processing through concurrency and compiled Python (Cython), high-level networking, and graphics. He identifies well-proven design patterns that are useful in Python, illuminates them with expert-quality code, and explains why some object-oriented design patterns are irrelevant to Python. He also explodes several counterproductive myths about Python programming-showing, for example, how Python can take full advantage of multicore hardware. All examples, including three complete case studies, have been tested with Python 3.3 (and, where possible, Python 3.2 and 3.1) and crafted to maintain compatibility with future Python 3.x versions. All code has been tested on Linux, and most code has also been tested on OS X and Windows. All code may be downloaded at <a href=\"http://www.qtrac.eu/pipbook.html\">www.qtrac.eu/pipbook.html</a>. Coverage includes Leveraging Python's most effective creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns Supporting concurrency with Python's multiprocessing, threading, and concurrent.futures modules Avoiding concurrency problems using thread-safe queues and futures rather than fragile locks Simplifying networking with high-level modules, including xmlrpclib and RPyC Accelerating Python code with Cython, C-based Python modules, profiling, and other techniques Creating modern-looking GUI applications with Tkinter Leveraging today's powerful graphics hardware via the OpenGL API using pyglet and PyOpenGL</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">Stochastic Dynamics for Systems Biology is one of the first books to provide a systematic study of the many stochastic models used in systems biology. The book shows how the mathematical models are used as technical tools for simulating biological processes and how the models lead to conceptual insights on the functioning of the cellular processing system. Most of the text should be accessible to scientists with basic knowledge in calculus and probability theory.   The authors illustrate the relevant Markov chain theory using realistic models from systems biology, including signaling and metabolic pathways, phosphorylation processes, genetic switches, and transcription. A central part of the book presents an original and up-to-date treatment of cooperativity. The book defines classical indexes, such as the Hill coefficient, using notions from statistical mechanics. It explains why binding curves often have S-shapes and why cooperative behaviors can lead to ultrasensitive genetic switches. These notions are then used to model transcription rates. Examples cover the phage lambda genetic switch and eukaryotic gene expression.  The book then presents a short course on dynamical systems and describes stochastic aspects of linear noise approximation. This mathematical framework enables the simplification of complex stochastic dynamics using Gaussian processes and nonlinear ODEs. Simple examples illustrate the technique in noise propagation in gene networks and the effects of network structures on multistability and gene expression noise levels. The last chapter provides up-to-date results on stochastic and deterministic mass action kinetics with applications to enzymatic biochemical reactions and metabolic pathways.</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">Elon Musk is the most daring entrepreneur of our time There are few industrialists in history who could match Elon Musk's relentless drive and ingenious vision. A modern alloy of Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Howard Hughes, and Steve Jobs, Musk is the man behind PayPal, Tesla Motors, SpaceX, and SolarCity, each of which has sent shock waves throughout American business and industry. More than any other executive today, Musk has dedicated his energies and his own vast fortune to inventing a future that is as rich and far-reaching as a science fiction fantasy.In this lively, investigative account, veteran technology journalist Ashlee Vance offers an unprecedented look into the remarkable life and times of Silicon Valley's most audacious businessman. Written with exclusive access to Musk, his family, and his friends, the book traces his journey from his difficult upbringing in South Africa to his ascent to the pinnacle of the global business world. Vance spent more than fifty hours in conversation with Musk and interviewed close to three hundred people to tell the tumultuous stories of Musk's world-changing companies and to paint a portrait of a complex man who has renewed American industry and sparked new levels of innovation—all while making plenty of enemies along the way.In 1992, Elon Musk arrived in the United States as a ferociously driven immigrant bent on realizing his wildest dreams. Since then, Musk's roller-coaster life has brought him grave disappointments alongside massive successes. After being forced out of PayPal, fending off a life-threatening case of malaria, and dealing with the death of his infant son, Musk abandoned Silicon Valley for Los Angeles. He spent the next few years baffling his friends by blowing his entire fortune on rocket ships and electric cars. Cut to 2012, however, and Musk had mounted one of the greatest resurrections in business history: Tesla, SpaceX, and SolarCity had enjoyed unparalleled success, and Musk's net worth soared to more than $5 billion. At a time when many American companies are more interested in chasing easy money than in taking bold risks on radical new technology, Musk stands out as the only businessman with enough dynamism and vision to tackle—and even revolutionize—three industries at once. Vance makes the case that Musk's success heralds a return to the original ambition and invention that made America an economic and intellectual powerhouse. Elon Musk is a brilliant, penetrating examination of what Musk's career means for a technology industry undergoing dramatic change and offers a taste of what could be an incredible century ahead.</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">What is <i>Exploring Abstract Algebra with Mathematica</i>? Exploring Abstract Algebra with Mathematica is a learning environment for introductory abstract algebra built around a suite of Mathematica packages entitled AbstractAlgebra. These packages are a foundation for this collection of twenty-seven interactive labs on group and ring theory. The lab portion of this book reflects the contents of the Mathematica-based electronic notebooks con tained in the accompanying CD-ROM. Students can interact with both the printed and electronic versions of the material in the laboratory and look up details and reference information in the User's Guide. Exercises occur in the stream of the text of labs, providing a context in which to answer. The notebooks are designed so that the answers to the questions can either be entered into the electronic notebook or written on paper, whichever the instructor prefers. The notebooks support versions 2. 2 and 3. 0-4. 0 and are compatible with all platforms that run Mathematica. This work can be used to supplement any introductory abstract algebra text and is not dependent on any particular text. The group and ring labs have been cross referenced against some of the more popular texts.

"<p class=\"description\">Quantum Mechanics for Chemists is designed to provide chemistry undergraduates with a basic understanding of the principles of quantum mechanics. The text assumes some knowledge of chemical bonding and a familiarity with the qualitative aspects of molecular orbitals in molecules such as butadiene and benzene. Thus it is intended to follow a basic course in organic and/or inorganic chemistry. The approach is rather different from that adopted in most books on quantum chemistry in that the Schr/dinger wave equation is introduced at a fairly late stage, after students have become familiar with the application of de Broglie-type wavefunctions to free particles and particles in a box. Likewise, the Hamiltonian operator and the concept of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues are not introduced until the last two chapters of the book, where approximate solutions to the wave equation for many-electron atoms and molecules are discussed. In this way, students receive a gradual introduction to the basic concepts of quantum mechanics. Ideal for the needs of undergraduate chemistry students, Tutorial Chemistry Texts is a major series consisting of short, single topic or modular texts concentrating on the fundamental areas of chemistry taught in undergraduate science courses. Each book provides a concise account of the basic principles underlying a given subject, embodying an independent-learning philosophy and including worked examples.\"</p>"
"In his first book ever, the father of string theory reinvents our concept of the known universe and mans unique place within it. The beginning of the 21st century is a watershed in modern science, a time that will forever change our understanding of the universe, Leonard Susskind contends. Several decades ago, Susskind introduced the revolutionary concept of string theory to the world of physical science. In doing so, he inspired a generation of physicists who believed that the theory would uniquely predict the properties of our universe. Now, in his first book ever, Susskind argues that the very idea of such an elegant theory no longer suits our understanding of the universe, and that our narrow 20th-century view of a unique universe will have to give way to the much broader concept of a gigantic cosmic landscapea megaverse, pregnant with new possibilities. His other contributions to physics are too numerous to mention, but his recent victory in an argument with Stephen Hawking over the nature of black holes made headlines everywhere."
"<p class=\"description\">In this unconventional and stimulating primer, world-class physicist Leonard Susskind and citizen-scientist George Hrabovsky combine forces to provide a brilliant first course in modern physics. Unlike most popular physics books - which give readers a taste of what physicists know but not what they actually do - Susskind and Hrabovsky teach the skills you need to do physics yourself. Combining crystal-clear explanations of the laws of the universe with basic exercises, the authors cover the minimum - the theoretical minimum of the title - that readers need to master in order to study more advanced topics. In a lucid, engaging style, they introduce all the key concepts, from classical mechanics to general relativity to quantum theory. Instead of shying away from the equations and maths that are essential to any understanding of physics, The Theoretical Minimum provides a toolkit that you won't find in any other popular science book.</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">Chemistry, physics and biology are by their nature genuinely difficult. Mathematics, however, is man-made, and therefore not as complicated. Two ideas form the basis for this book: 1) to use ordinary mathematics to describe the simplicity in the structure of mathematics and 2) to develop new branches of mathematics to describe natural sciences.Mathematics can be described as the addition, subtraction or multiplication of planes. Using the exponential scale the authors show that the addition of planes gives the polyhedra, or any solid. The substraction of planes gives saddles. The multiplication of planes gives the general saddle equations and the multispirals. The equation of symmetry is derived, which contains the exponential scale with its functions for solids, the complex exponentials with the nodal surfaces, and the GD (Gauss Distribution) mathematics with finite periodicity.Piece by piece, the authors have found mathematical functions for the geometrical descriptions of chemical structures and the structure building operations. Using the mathematics for dilatation; twins, trillings, fourlings and sixlings are made, and using GD mathematics these are made periodic. This description of a structure is the nature of mathematics itself. Crystal structures and 3D mathematics are synonyms. Mathematics are used to describe rod packings, Olympic rings and defects in solids. Giant molecules such as cubosomes, the DNA double helix, and certain building blocks in protein structures are also described mathematically.</p>"

Imagine, then, a computer in which speed is increased not because it runs faster, but because it has a limitless army of different jugglers, one for each billiard cue. Imagine the quantum computer.  </p>\n<p>Julian Brown's record of the quest for the Holy Grail of computing -- a computer that could, in theory, take seconds to perform calculations that would take today's fastest supercomputers longer than the age of the universe -- is an extraordinary tale, populated by a remarkable cast of characters, including David Deutsch of Oxford University, who first announced the possibility of computation in the Alice-in-Wonderland world of quantum mechanics; Ed Fredkin, who developed a new kind of logic gate as a true step toward universal computation; and the legendary Richard Feynman, who reasoned from the inability to model quantum mechanics on a classical computer the logical inevitability of quantum computing.  </p>\n<p>For, in the fuzzily indeterminate world of the quantum, new computing power is born. \"Minds, Machines, and the Multiverse\" details the remarkable uses for quantum computing in code breaking, for quantum computers will be able to crack many of the leading methods of protecting secret information, while offering new unbreakable codes. Quantum computers will also be able to model nuclear and subatomic reactions; offerinsights into nanotechnology, teleportation, and time travel; and perhaps change the way chemists and biotechnologists design drugs and study the molecules of life. Farthest along the trail blazed by these pioneers is the ability to visualize the multiple realities of the quantum world not as a mathematical abstraction, but as a real map to a world of multiple universes...a \"multiverse\" where every possible event -- from a particular chess move to a comet striking the Earth -- not only can happen, but \"does.\"  </p>\n<p>Incorporating lively explanations of ion trap gates, nuclear magnetic resonance computers, quantum dots, quantum algorithms, Fourier transforms, and puzzles of quantum physics, and illustrated with dozens of vivid diagrams, \"Minds, Machines, and the Multiverse\" is a mind-stretching look at the still-unbuilt but fascinating machines that, in the words of physicist Stanley Williams, \"will reshape the face of science\" and offer a new window into the secrets of an infinite number of potential universes.</p></div>"

"<p class=\"description\">The race is on to construct the first quantum code breaker, as the winner will hold the key to the entire Internet. From international, multibillion-dollar financial transactions to top-secret government communications, all would be vulnerable to the secret-code-breaking ability of the quantum computer.   Written by a renowned quantum physicist closely involved in the U.S. government’s development of quantum information science, Schrödinger’s Killer App: Race to Build the World’s First Quantum Computer presents an inside look at the government’s quest to build a quantum computer capable of solving complex mathematical problems and hacking the public-key encryption codes used to secure the Internet. The \"killer application\" refers to Shor’s quantum factoring algorithm, which would unveil the encrypted communications of the entire Internet if a quantum computer could be built to run the algorithm. Schrödinger’s notion of quantum entanglement—and his infamous cat—is at the heart of it all.  The book develops the concept of entanglement in the historical context of Einstein’s 30-year battle with the physics community over the true meaning of quantum theory. It discusses the remedy to the threat posed by the quantum code breaker: quantum cryptography, which is unbreakable even by the quantum computer. The author also covers applications to other important areas, such as quantum physics simulators, synchronized clocks, quantum search engines, quantum sensors, and imaging devices. In addition, he takes readers on a philosophical journey that considers the future ramifications of quantum technologies.  Interspersed with amusing and personal anecdotes, this book presents quantum computing and the closely connected foundations of quantum mechanics in an engaging manner accessible to non-specialists. Requiring no formal training in physics or advanced mathematics, it explains difficult topics, including quantum entanglement, Schrödinger’s cat, Bell’s inequality, and quantum computational complexity, using simple analogies.</p>"

"<div><p>Gravity, a Geometrical Course presents general relativity (GR) in a systematic and exhaustive way, covering three aspects that are homogenized into a single texture: i) the mathematical, geometrical foundations, exposed in a self consistent contemporary formalism, ii) the main physical, astrophysical and cosmological applications, updated to the issues of contemporary research and observations, with glimpses on supergravity and superstring theory, iii) the historical development of scientific ideas underlying both the birth of general relativity and its subsequent evolution. The book is divided in two volumes.  </p>\n<p>Volume Two is covers black holes, cosmology and an introduction to supergravity. The aim of this volume is two-fold. It completes the presentation of GR and it introduces the reader to theory of gravitation beyond GR, which is supergravity. Starting with a short history of the black hole concept, the book covers the Kruskal extension of the Schwarzschild metric, the causal structures of Lorentzian manifolds, Penrose diagrams and a detailed analysis of the Kerr-Newman metric. An extensive historical account of the development of modern cosmology is followed by a detailed presentation of its mathematical structure, including non-isotropic cosmologies and billiards, de Sitter space and inflationary scenarios, perturbation theory and anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Background. The last three chapters deal with the mathematical and conceptual foundations of supergravity in the frame of free differential algebras. Branes are presented both as classical solutions of the bulk theory and as world-volume gauge theories with particular emphasis on the geometrical interpretation of kappa-supersymmetry. The rich bestiary of special geometries underlying supergravity lagrangians is presented, followed by a chapter providing glances on the equally rich collection of special solutions of supergravity.  </p>\n<p>Pietro Fre is Professor of Theoretical Physics at the University of Torino, Italy and is currently serving as Scientific Counsellor of the Italian Embassy in Moscow.

"<p>This is a book about prime numbers, congruences, secret messages, and elliptic curves that you can read cover to cover. It grew out of undergr- uate courses that the author taught at Harvard, UC San Diego, and the University of Washington. The systematic study of number theory was initiated around 300B. C. when Euclid proved that there are in?nitely many prime numbers, and also cleverly deduced the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which asserts that every positive integer factors uniquely as a product of primes. Over a thousand years later (around 972A. D. ) Arab mathematicians formulated the congruent number problem that asks for a way to decide whether or not a given positive integer n is the area of a right triangle, all three of whose sides are rational numbers. Then another thousand years later (in 1976), Di?e and Hellman introduced the ?rst ever public-key cryptosystem, which enabled two people to communicate secretely over a public communications channel with no predetermined secret; this invention and the ones that followed it revolutionized the world of digital communication. In the 1980s and 1990s, elliptic curves revolutionized number theory, providing striking new insights into the congruent number problem, primality testing, publ- key cryptography, attacks on public-key systems, and playing a central role in Andrew Wiles' resolution of Fermat's Last Theorem.</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">Presenting theory while using Mathematica in a complementary way, Modern Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces with Mathematica, the third edition of Alfred Gray’s famous textbook, covers how to define and compute standard geometric functions using Mathematica for constructing new curves and surfaces from existing ones. Since Gray’s death, authors Abbena and Salamon have stepped in to bring the book up to date. While maintaining Gray's intuitive approach, they reorganized the material to provide a clearer division between the text and the Mathematica code and added a Mathematica notebook as an appendix to each chapter. They also address important new topics, such as quaternions. The approach of this book is at times more computational than is usual for a book on the subject. For example, Brioshi’s formula for the Gaussian curvature in terms of the first fundamental form can be too complicated for use in hand calculations, but Mathematica handles it easily, either through computations or through graphing curvature. Another part of Mathematica that can be used effectively in differential geometry is its special function library, where nonstandard spaces of constant curvature can be defined in terms of elliptic functions and then plotted. Using the techniques described in this book, readers will understand concepts geometrically, plotting curves and surfaces on a monitor and then printing them. Containing more than 300 illustrations, the book demonstrates how to use Mathematica to plot many interesting curves and surfaces. Including as many topics of the classical differential geometry and surfaces as possible, it highlights important theorems with many examples. It includes 300 miniprograms for computing and plotting various geometric objects, alleviating the drudgery of computing things such as the curvature and torsion of a curve in space.</p>"

Through the Maple applications, the reader is given tools for creating the shapes that are being studied. Thus, you can see a fluid rising up an inclined plane, create minimal surfaces from complex variables data, and investigate the true shape of a balloon. Oprea also includes descriptions of experiments and photographs that let you see real soap films on wire frames. The theory of minimal surfaces is a beautiful subject, which naturally introduces the reader to fascinating, yet accessible, topics in mathematics.</p>"
"<p class=\"description\">The first contemporary textbook on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to include instructions on MATLAB®, Mathematica®, and MapleTM, A Course in Ordinary Differential Equations focuses on applications and methods of analytical and numerical solutions, emphasizing approaches used in the typical engineering, physics, or mathematics student's field of study.Stressing applications wherever possible, the authors have written this text with the applied math, engineer, or science major in mind. It includes a number of modern topics that are not commonly found in a traditional sophomore-level text. For example, Chapter 2 covers direction fields, phase line techniques, and the Runge-Kutta method; another chapter discusses linear algebraic topics, such as transformations and eigenvalues. Chapter 6 considers linear and nonlinear systems of equations from a dynamical systems viewpoint and uses the linear algebra insights from the previous chapter; it also includes modern applications like epidemiological models. With sufficient problems at the end of each chapter, even the pure math major will be fully challenged. Although traditional in its coverage of basic topics of ODEs, A Course in Ordinary Differential Equations is one of the first texts to provide relevant computer code and instruction in MATLAB, Mathematica, and Maple that will prepare students for further study in their fields.</p>"
"<p class=\"description\">Thirty years ago mathematical, as opposed to applied numerical, computation was difficult to perform and so relatively little used. Three threads changed that: the emergence of the personal computer; the discovery of fiber-optics and the consequent development of the modern internet; and the building of the Three M's Maple, Mathematica and Matlab. We intend to persuade that Mathematica and other similar tools are worth knowing, assuming only that one wishes to be a mathematician, a mathematics educator, a computer scientist, an engineer or scientist, or anyone else who wishes/needs to use mathematics better. We also hope to explain how to become an \"experimental mathematician\" while learning to be better at proving things. To accomplish this our material is divided into three main chapters followed by a postscript. These cover elementary number theory, calculus of one and several variables, introductory linear algebra, and visualization and interactive geometric computation.</p>"

"<p>Mathematics is undoubtedly the key to state-of-the-art high technology. It is an international technical language and proves to be an eternally young science to those who have learned its ways. Long an indispensable part of research thanks to modeling and simulation, mathematics is enjoying particular vit- ity now more than ever. Nevertheless, this stormy development is resulting in increasingly high requirements for students in technical disciplines, while general interest in mathematics continues to wane at the same time. This book and its appendices on the Internet seek to deal with this issue, helping students master the dificult transition from the receptive to the productive phase of their education. The author has repeatedly held a three-semester introductory course titled Higher Mathematics at the University of Stuttgart and used a series of handouts to show further aspects, make the course contents more motivating, and connect with the mechanics lectures taking place at the same time. One part of the book has more or less evolved from this on its own. True to the original objective, this part treats a variety of separate topics of varying degrees of difficulty; nevertheless, all these topics are oriented to mechanics. Another part of this book seeks to erase lection of understandable realistic models that can be implemented directly from the multitude of mathematical resources. The author does not attempt to hide his preference of Numerical Mathematics and thus places importance on careful theoretical preparation.</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">The use of computation and simulation has become an essential part of the scientific process. Being able to transform a theory into an algorithm requires significant theoretical insight, detailed physical and mathematical understanding, and a working level of competency in programming.  This upper-division text provides an unusually broad survey of the topics of modern computational physics from a multidisciplinary, computational science point of view. Its philosophy is rooted in learning by doing (assisted by many model programs), with new scientific materials as well as with the Python programming language. Python has become very popular, particularly for physics education and large scientific projects. It is probably the easiest programming language to learn for beginners, yet is also used for mainstream scientific computing, and has packages for excellent graphics and even symbolic manipulations. The text is designed for an upper-level undergraduate or beginning graduate course and provides the reader with the essential knowledge to understand computational tools and mathematical methods well enough to be successful. As part of the teaching of using computers to solve scientific problems, the reader is encouraged to work through a sample problem stated at the beginning of each chapter or unit, which involves studying the text, writing, debugging and running programs, visualizing the results, and the expressing in words what has been done and what can be concluded. Then there are exercises and problems at the end of each chapter for the reader to work on their own (with model programs given for that purpose).</p>"

"<p>If classical Lie groups preserve bilinear vector norms, what Lie groups preserve trilinear, quadrilinear, and higher order invariants? Answering this question from a fresh and original perspective, Predrag Cvitanovic takes the reader on the amazing, four-thousand-diagram journey through the theory of Lie groups. This book is the first to systematically develop, explain, and apply diagrammatic projection operators to construct all semi-simple Lie algebras, both classical and exceptional.<br>\nThe invariant tensors are presented in a somewhat unconventional, but in recent years widely used, \"birdtracks\" notation inspired by the Feynman diagrams of quantum field theory. Notably, invariant tensor diagrams replace algebraic reasoning in carrying out all group-theoretic computations. The diagrammatic approach is particularly effective in evaluating complicated coefficients and group weights, and revealing symmetries hidden by conventional algebraic or index notations. The book covers most topics needed in applications from this new perspective: permutations, Young projection operators, spinorial representations, Casimir operators, and Dynkin indices. Beyond this well-traveled territory, more exotic vistas open up, such as \"negative dimensional\" relations between various groups and their representations. The most intriguing result of classifying primitive invariants is the emergence of all exceptional Lie groups in a single family, and the attendant pattern of exceptional and classical Lie groups, the so-called Magic Triangle. Written in a lively and personable style, the book is aimed at researchers and graduate students in theoretical physics and mathematics.  </p>"

"<div><p><strong>From Paul Mason, the award-winning Channel 4 presenter, <em>Postcapitalism</em> is a guide to our era of seismic economic change, and how we can build a more equal society. </strong>  </p>\n<p>Over the past two centuries or so, capitalism has undergone continual change - economic cycles that lurch from boom to bust - and has always emerged transformed and strengthened. Surveying this turbulent history, Paul Mason wonders whether today we are on the brink of a change so big, so profound, that this time capitalism itself, the immensely complex system by which entire societies function, has reached its limits and is changing into something wholly new.  </p>\n<p>At the heart of this change is information technology: a revolution that, as Mason shows, has the potential to reshape utterly our familiar notions of work, production and value; and to destroy an economy based on markets and private ownership - in fact, he contends, it is already doing so. Almost unnoticed, in the niches and hollows of the market system, whole swathes of economic life are changing.. Goods and services that no longer respond to the dictates of neoliberalism are appearing, from parallel currencies and time banks, to cooperatives and self-managed online spaces. Vast numbers of people are changing their behaviour, discovering new forms of ownership, lending and doing business that are distinct from, and contrary to, the current system of state-backed corporate capitalism.  </p>\n<p>In this groundbreaking book Mason shows how, from the ashes of the recent financial crisis, we have the chance to create a more socially just and sustainable global economy. Moving beyond capitalism, he shows, is no longer a utopian dream. This is the first time in human history in which, equipped with an understanding of what is happening around us, we can predict and shape, rather than simply react to, seismic change.</p></div>"

"<p class=\"description\">Spivak's celebrated textbook is widely held as one of the finest introductions to mathematical analysis. His aim is to present calculus as the first real encounter with mathematics: it is the place to learn how logical reasoning combined with fundamental concepts can be developed into a rigorous mathematical theory rather than a bunch of tools and techniques learned by rote. Since analysis is a subject students traditionally find difficult to grasp, Spivak provides leisurely explanations, a profusion of examples, a wide range of exercises and plenty of illustrations in an easy-going approach that enlightens difficult concepts and rewards effort. Calculus will continue to be regarded as a modern classic, ideal for honours students and mathematics majors, who seek an alternative to doorstop textbooks on calculus, and the more formidable introductions to real analysis.</p>"

"<p>This little book is especially concerned with those portions of ”advanced calculus” in which the subtlety of the concepts and methods makes rigor difficult to attain at an elementary level. The approach taken here uses elementary versions of modern methods found in sophisticated mathematics. The formal prerequisites include only a term of linear algebra, a nodding acquaintance with the notation of set theory, and a respectable first-year calculus course (one which at least mentions the least upper bound (sup) and greatest lower bound (inf) of a set of real numbers). Beyond this a certain (perhaps latent) rapport with abstract mathematics will be found almost essential.</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">The design and development of electrical devices involves choosing from many possible variants that which is the best or optimum according to one or several criteria. These optimization criteria are usually already clear to the designer at the statement of the design problem. The methods of optimization considered in this book, allow us to sort out variants of the realization of a design on the basis of these criteria and to create the best device in the sense of the set criteria. Optimization of devices is one of the major problems in electrical engi neering that is related to an extensive class of inverse problems including synthesis, diagnostics, fault detection, identification, and some others with common mathematical properties. When designing a device, the engineer ac tually solves inverse problems by defining the device structure and its pa rameters, and then proceeds to deal with the technical specifications followed by the incorporation of his own notions of the best device. Frequently the so lutions obtained are based on intuition and previous experience. New meth ods and approaches discussed in this book will add mathematical rigor to these intuitive notions. By virtue of their urgency inverse problems have been investigated for more than a century. However, general methods for their solution have been developed only recently. An analysis of the scientific literature indicates a steadily growing interest among scientists and engineers in these problems.</p>"
"<p class=\"description\">Figure Drawing: Design and Invention is an instructional figure drawing book geared towards the novice and experienced artist alike. In approaching the figure, this book emphasizes a simplified understanding of surface anatomy, in order to allow for artists to understand invention and mechanics of the figure, creating a successful skill-set that can be applied in both traditional and computer-based fields. In addition, this book focuses very strongly on process.

The following concepts are illustrated and their possibilities and limitations are given: - potential energy surfaces; - simple and extended Huckel methods; - ab initio, AM1 and related semiempirical methods; - density functional theory (DFT). Topics are placed in a historical context, adding interest to them and removing much of their apparently arbitrary aspect. The large number of references, to all significant topics mentioned, should make this book useful not only to undergraduates but also to graduate students and academic and industrial researchers.</p>"

"<p>In this third volume of <i>A Course in Mathematical Physics</i> I have attempted not simply to introduce axioms and derive quantum mechanics from them, but also to progress to relevant applications. Reading the axiomatic litera ture often gives one the impression that it largely consists of making refined axioms, thereby freeing physics from any trace of down-to-earth residue and cutting it off from simpler ways of thinking. The goal pursued here, however, is to come up with concrete results that can be compared with experimental facts. Everything else should be regarded only as a side issue, and has been chosen for pragmatic reasons. It is precisely with this in mind that I feel it appropriate to draw upon the most modern mathematical methods. Only by their means can the logical fabric of quantum theory be woven with a smooth structure; in their absence, rough spots would . inevitably appear, especially in the theory of unbounded operators, where the details are too intricate to be comprehended easily. Great care has been taken to build up this mathematical weaponry as completely as possible, as it is also the basic arsenal of the next volume. This means that many proofs have been tucked away in the exercises. My greatest concern was to replace the ordinary cal culations of uncertain accuracy with better ones having error bounds, in order to raise the crude manners of theoretical physics to the more cultivated level of experimental physics.\"</p>"
"<p>The origins of computation group theory (CGT) date back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since then, the field has flourished, particularly during the past 30 to 40 years, and today it remains a lively and active branch of mathematics. The Handbook of Computational Group Theory offers the first complete treatment of all the fundamental methods and algorithms in CGT presented at a level accessible even to advanced undergraduate students. It develops the theory of algorithms in full detail and highlights the connections between the different aspects of CGT and with other areas of computer algebra. While acknowledging the importance of the complexity analysis of CGT algorithms, the authors' primary focus is on algorithms that perform well in practice rather than on those with the best theoretical complexity. Throughout the book, applications of all the key topics and algorithms to areas both within and outside of mathematics demonstrate how CGT fits into the wider world of mathematics and science. The authors include detailed pseudocode for all of the fundamental algorithms, and provide detailed worked examples that bring the theorems and algorithms to life.</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">\"Graph Theory presents a natural, reader-friendly way to learn some of the essential ideas of graph theory starting from first principles. The format is similar to the companion text, Combinatorics: A Problem Oriented Approach also by Daniel A. Marcus, in that it combines the features of a textbook with those of a problem workbook. The material is presented through a series of approximately 360 strategically placed problems with connecting text. This is supplemented by 280 additional problems that are intended to be used as homework assignments. Concepts of graph theory are introduced, developed, and reinforced by working through leading questions posed in the problems. This problem-oriented format is intended to promote active involvement by the reader while always providing clear direction. This approach figures prominently on the presentation of proofs, which become more frequent and elaborate as the book progresses. Arguments are arranged in digestible chunks and always appear along with concrete examples to keep the readers firmly grounded in their motivation. Spanning tree algorithms, Euler paths, Hamilton paths and cycles, planar graphs, independence and covering, connections and obstructions, and vertex and edge colorings make up the core of the book. Hall's Theorem, the Konig-Egervary Theorem, Dilworth's Theorem and the Hungarian algorithm to the optional assignment problem, matrices, and Latin squares are also explored.\"--Back cover.</p>"
"<p>Proteins lie at the heart of almost all biological processes and have an incredibly wide range of activities. Central to the function of all proteins is their ability to adopt, stably or sometimes transiently, structures that allow for interaction with other molecules. An understanding of the structure of a protein can therefore lead us to a much improved picture of its molecular function. This realisation has been a prime motivation of recent Structural Genomics projects, involving large-scale experimental determination of protein structures, often those of proteins about which little is known of function. These initiatives have, in turn, stimulated the massive development of novel methods for prediction of protein function from structure. Since model structures may also take advantage of new function prediction algorithms, the first part of the book deals with the various ways in which protein structures may be predicted or inferred, including specific treatment of membrane and intrinsically disordered proteins. A detailed consideration of current structure-based function prediction methodologies forms the second part of this book, which concludes with two chapters, focusing specifically on case studies, designed to illustrate the real-world application of these methods. With bang up-to-date texts from world experts, and abundant links to publicly available resources, this book will be invaluable to anyone who studies proteins and the endlessly fascinating relationship between their structure and function.</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">The goal of this book is to present basic optimization theory and modern computational algorithms in a concise manner. The book is suitable for un dergraduate and graduate students in all branches of engineering, operations research, and management information systems. The book should also be use ful for practitioners who are interested in learning optimization and using these techniques on their own. Most available books in the field tend to be either too theoretical or present computational algorithms in a cookbook style. An approach that falls some where in between these two extremes is adopted in this book. Theory is pre sented in an informal style to make sense to most undergraduate and graduate students in engineering and business. Computational algorithms are also de veloped in an informal style by appealing to readers' intuition rather than mathematical rigor. The available, computationally oriented books generally present algorithms alone and expect readers to perform computations by hand or implement these algorithms by themselves. This obviously is unrealistic for a usual introductory optimization course in which a wide variety of optimization algorithms are discussed. There are some books that present programs written in traditional computer languages such as Basic, FORTRAN, or Pascal. These programs help with computations, but are of limited value in developing understanding of the algorithms because they provide very little information about the intermediate steps.</p>"

Students can read the text and work with the software at a pace that they can enjoy, varying parameters of the simulated systems and repeating the most important and interesting experiments on their own. Each section of the textbook is supplied with questions, exercises, and problems. Using some of the suggested simulation programs, students have an opportunity to perform interesting mini-research projects in physics and astronomy. The experience based on student's own actions results in deeper understanding than the mere reception of someone else's knowledge, as a visual impression is much more intensive and permanent than a heard or read one. The simulation programs, with a wealth of predefined examples, make visible the beauty and aesthetics of the mathematics and of the fundamental laws of physics in their application to the motions of celestial bodie</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">An Introduction to Modern Cosmology is an accessible account of modern cosmological ideas. The Big Bang Cosmology is explored, looking at its observational successes in explaining the expansion of the Universe, the existence and properties of the cosmic microwave background, and the origin of light elements in the universe. Properties of the very early Universe are also covered, including the motivation for a rapid period of expansion known as cosmological inflation. The Advanced Topic sections present subjects with more detailed mathematical approaches to give greater depth to discussions. Student problems with hints for solving them and numerical answers are embedded in the chapters to facilitate the reader’s understanding and learning. Cosmology is now part of the core in many degree programs. This current, clear and concise introductory text is relevant to a wide range of astronomy programs worldwide and is essential reading for undergraduates and Masters students, as well as anyone starting research in cosmology. Supplementary material, including full-colour images, updates and links for students and instructors, is available on the author’s website: http://www.roe.ac.uk/~arl/.</p>"
"<p>Recent developments in cosmology and particle physics, such as the string landscape picture, have led to the remarkable realization that our universe - rather than being unique - could be just one of many universes. The multiverse proposal helps to explain the origin of the universe and some of its observational features. Since the physical constants can be different in other universes, the fine-tunings which appear necessary for the emergence of life may also be explained. Nevertheless, many physicists remain uncomfortable with the multiverse proposal, since it is highly speculative and perhaps untestable. In this volume, a number of active and eminent researchers in the field - mainly cosmologists and particle physicists but also some philosophers - address these issues and describe recent developments. The articles represent the full spectrum of views, providing for the first time an overview of the subject. They are written at different academic levels, engaging lay-readers and researchers alike.</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">Quantum theory is so shocking that Einstein could not bring himself to accept it. It is so important that it provides the fundamental underpinning of all modern sciences. Without it, we'd have no nuclear power or nuclear weapons, no TV, no computers, no science of molecular biology, no understanding of DNA, no genetic engineering. In Search of Schrodinger's Cat tells the complete story of quantum mechanics, a truth stranger than any fiction. John Gribbin takes us step by step into an ever more bizarre and fascinating place, requiring only that we approach it with an open mind. He introduces the scientists who developed quantum theory. He investigates the atom, radiation, time travel, the birth of the universe, superconductors and life itself. And in a world full of its own delights, mysteries and surprises, he searches for Schrodinger's Cat - a search for quantum reality - as he brings every reader to a clear understanding of the most important area of scientific study today - quantum physics. In Search of Schrodinger's Cat is a fascinating and delightful introduction to the strange world of the quantum - an essential element in understanding today's world.From the Trade Paperback edition.</p>"
"<div><p>The quantum computer is no longer the stuff of science fiction. Pioneering physicists are on the brink of unlocking a new quantum universe which provides a better representation of reality than our everyday experiences and common sense ever could. The birth of quantum computers – which, like Schrödinger’s famous ‘dead and alive’ cat, rely on entities like electrons, photons or atoms existing in two states at the same time – is set to turn the computing world on its head.  </p><p>\n</p><p>In his fascinating study of this cutting-edge technology, John Gribbin updates his previous views on the nature of quantum reality, arguing for a universe of many parallel worlds where ‘everything is real’. Looking back to Alan Turing’s work on the Enigma machine and the first electronic computer, Gribbin explains how quantum theory developed to make quantum computers work in practice as well as in principle. He takes us beyond the arena of theoretical physics to explore their practical applications – from machines which learn through ‘intuition’ and trial and error to unhackable laptops and smartphones. And he investigates the potential for this extraordinary science to create a world where communication occurs faster than light and teleportation is possible.</p></div>"

"<p class=\"description\">We once had to abandon the idea of earth being at the centre of the universe. Now, we need to confront an even more profound possibility: the universe itself might just be one universe among many. \"In Search of the Multiverse\" takes us on an extraordinary journey, examining the most fundamental questions in science. What are the boundaries of our universe? Can there be different physical laws from the ones we know? Are there in fact other universes? Do we really live in a multiverse? This book is a search - the ultimate search - exploring the frontiers of reality. Ideas that were once science fiction have now come to dominate modern physics. And, as John Gribbin shows, there is increasing evidence that there really is more to the universe than we can see. Gribbin guides us through the different competing theories (there is more than one multiverse!) revealing what they have in common and what we can come to expect. He gives a brilliant tour of the current state of cosmology. John Gribbin is our best, most accessible guide to the big questions of science.

"<p class=\"description\">Mr. Bridgman states unequivocally in his introduction that before preparing this book he had \"not discovered a single volume devoted exclusively to the depicting of the hand.\" Apparently Mr. Bridgman has appreciated what few others have felt — the human hand's great capacity for expression and the care that the artist must take to realize it. The hand changes with the age of the person, is shaped differently according to sex, reflects the type of work to which it is put, the physical health, and even the emotions of the person. To represent these distinguishing features, to capture the expressiveness of a particular pair of hands, the artist must understand the construction, anatomy, formation, and function of the hand.There is probably no better instructor to turn to for this understanding than Mr. Bridgman, a well-respected artist who for nearly 50 years lectured and taught at the Art Students League of New York. In this volume, a full text is accompanied by many illustrations depicting virtually every aspect and posture of the human hand. He first considers the back view of the hand, the wrist bones, the tendons, the muscles, the hand bones, the arch, and the veins; and then those of the palm. Throughout he pictures the musculature at work beneath the surface of the skin. He continues by showing how the muscles operate on the thumb side and on the little finger side when each is the center of force; how the thumb and fingers are constructed, their freedom of movement, joints, and complete anatomy as well as views of them straight, bent, and flexed; how the knuckles are formed, what shapes the fist can take and how flexible it can be; and he concludes with illustrations of the total movement, either turning or rotary, of the hand in its various positions.The 100 illustrations the author has selected perfectly define the regions of the hand so that any artist, beginning or experienced, will increase his mastery of it. Better rendering of the human hand is sure to add new expressiveness to your human figures along with new forcefulness and new interest.</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">No winners, no losers, and no end — the Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is no ordinary computer game. Created by British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970, Life debuted in Scientific American, where it was hailed as the key to a new area of mathematical research, the field of cellular automata. Less of a game than a demonstration of logical possibilities, Life is based on simple rules and produces patterns of light and dark on computer screens that reflect the unpredictability, complexity, and beauty of the universe. This fascinating popular science journey explores Life's relationship to concepts in information theory, explaining the application of natural law to random systems and demonstrating the necessity of limits.

"<p class=\"description\">Unlike most textbooks on electromagnetic theory, which treat electricity, magnetism, Coulomb's law and Faraday's law as almost independent subjects within the framework of the theory, this well-written text takes a relativistic point of view in which electric and magnetic fields are really different aspects of the same physical quantity.Suitable for advanced undergraduates and graduate students, this volume offers a superb exposition of the essential unity of electromagnetism in its natural , relativistic framework while demonstrating the powerful constraint of relativistic invariance. It will be seen that all electromagnetism follows from electrostatics and from the requirement for the simplest laws allowable under the relativistic constraint. By means of these insights, the author hopes to encourage students to think about theories as yet undeveloped and to see this model as useful in other areas of physics.After an introductory chapter establishing the mathematical background of the subject and a survey of some new mathematical ideas, the author reviews the principles of electrostatics. He then introduces Einstein's special theory of relativity and applies it throughout the rest of the book. Topics treated range from Gauss's theorem, Coulomb's law, the Faraday effect and Fresnel's equations to multiple expansion of the radiation field , interference and diffraction, waveguides and cavities and electric and magnetic susceptibility.Carefully selected problems at the end of each chapter invite readers to test their grasp of the material. Professor Schwartz received his Ph.D. from Columbia University and has taught physics there and at Stanford University.

"<div><p class=\"description\">\"A great delight to read.\"--<i> Physics Today</i></p><p class=\"description\">Among the most fertile areas of modern physics, many-body theory has produced a wealth of fundamental results in all areas of the discipline. Unfortunately the subject is notoriously difficult and, until the publication of this book, most treatments of the topic were inaccessible to the average experimenter or non-specialist theoretician.The present work, by contrast, is well within the grasp of the nonexpert. It is intended primarily as a \"self-study\" book that introduces one aspect of many-body theory, i.e. the method of Feynman diagrams. The book also lends itself to use as a reference in courses on solid state and nuclear physics which make some use of the many-body techniques. And, finally, it can be used as a supplementary reference in a many-body course.Chapters 1 through 6 provide an introduction to the major concepts of the field, among them Feynman diagrams, quasi-particles, and vacuum amplitudes. Chapters 7 through 16 give basic coverage to topics ranging from Dyson's equation and the ladder approximation to Fermi systems at finite temperature and superconductivity. Appendixes summarize the Dirac formalism and include a rigorous derivation of the rules for diagrams. Problems are provided at the end of each chapter and solutions are given at the back of the book.For this second edition, Dr. Mattuck, formerly of the H. C. Orsted Institute and the University of Copenhagen, added to many chapters a new section showing in mathematical detail how typical many-body calculations with Feynman diagrams are carried out. In addition, new exercises were included, some of which gave the reader the opportunity to carry out simpler many-body calculations himself. A new chapter on the quantum field theory of phase transitions rounds out this unusually clear, helpful, and informative guide to the physics of the many-body problem.Unabridged Dover (1992) republication of the second edition published by McGraw-Hill International Book Company.</p></div>"

The notions of proper and improper complex numbers and of infinity are fully and clearly explained, as is stereographic projection. Individual chapters then cover limits and continuity, differentiation of analytic functions, polynomials and rational functions, Mobius transformations with their circle-preserving property, exponentials and logarithms, complex integrals and the Cauchy theorem , complex series and uniform convergence, power series, Laurent series and singular points, the residue theorem and its implications, harmonic functions (a subject too often slighted in first courses in complex analysis), partial fraction expansions, conformal mapping, and analytic continuation.<br>\nElementary functions are given a more detailed treatment than is usual for a book at this level. Also, there is an extended discussion of the Schwarz-Christolfel transformation, which is particularly important for applications.<br>\nThere is a great abundance of worked-out examples, and over three hundred problems (some with hints and answers), making this an excellent textbook for classroom use as well as for independent study.

"<p class=\"description\">Highly regarded for its exceptional clarity, imaginative and instructive exercises, and fine writing style, this concise book offers an ideal introduction to the fundamentals of topology. Originally conceived as a text for a one-semester course, it is directed to undergraduate students whose studies of calculus sequence have included definitions and proofs of theorems. The book's principal aim is to provide a simple, thorough survey of elementary topics in the study of collections of objects, or sets, that possess a mathematical structure.The author begins with an informal discussion of set theory in Chapter 1, reserving coverage of countability for Chapter 5, where it appears in the context of compactness. In the second chapter Professor Mendelson discusses metric spaces, paying particular attention to various distance functions which may be defined on Euclidean n-space and which lead to the ordinary topology. Chapter 3 takes up the concept of topological space, presenting it as a generalization of the concept of a metric space. Chapters 4 and 5 are devoted to a discussion of the two most important topological properties: connectedness and compactness. Throughout the text, Dr. Mendelson, a former Professor of Mathematics at Smith College, has included many challenging and stimulating exercises to help students develop a solid grasp of the material presented.</p>"
"<p class=\"description\">Employing a practical, \"learn by doing\" approach, this first-rate text fosters the development of the skills beyond the pure mathematics needed to set up and manipulate mathematical models. The author draws on a diversity of fields — including science, engineering, and operations research — to provide over 100 reality-based examples. Students learn from the examples by applying mathematical methods to formulate, analyze, and criticize models. Extensive documentation, consisting of over 150 references, supplements the models, encouraging further research on models of particular interest. The lively and accessible text requires only minimal scientific background. Designed for senior college or beginning graduate-level students, it assumes only elementary calculus and basic probability theory for the first part, and ordinary differential equations and continuous probability for the second section. All problems require students to study and create models, encouraging their active participation rather than a mechanical approach. Beyond the classroom, this volume will prove interesting and rewarding to anyone concerned with the development of mathematical models or the application of modeling to problem solving in a wide array of applications.</p>"
"<div><p class=\"description\">\"Excellent. The most valuable, detailed anatomical studies (which are also beautifully drawn) of all parts of the figure.\" - American Artist </p><p class=\"description\">\"The best book on artist's anatomy available anywhere.\" - Art Students League News </p><p class=\"description\">Countless artists and students since the 1920s have used this and other books by George B. Bridgman (for nearly 50 years a teacher at the Art Students League in New York) for a solid foundation and understanding of human anatomy. They have found, and continue to find, that his unique way of discovering the vitalizing forces in the human form and realizing them in drawing carries the student pleasantly over one of art's most severe hurdles. Bridgman's superb anatomical sketches, of which there are nearly 500 in the book, also bring clearly to fruition his lucid theories of how to draw the human body in its structure and its complex movements. Constructive Anatomy, an anatomical reference guide for the working artist, sculptor, and student, graphically shows important parts of the human body, both in motion and in repose ? hand, wrist, thumb, fingers, forearm, arm, armpit, shoulder, neck, head, eye, nose, ear, mouth, chin, trunk (front, side, and back), pelvis, hip, thigh, leg, knee, ankle, foot, and toes. Drawings of bone and muscle structure of the working of the joints and the interrelation of the various parts of the body are mainly concerned with movement of all sorts ? movements that are described in detail as well as illustrated. The bending, twisting,and turning, creasing and interlocking of the various parts of the body are represented in drawing as the wedging of masses in specific ways that are clearly defined by Mr. Bridgman. Every artist will save tedious hours of research with this simple but effective approach, and will be delighted with its directness and fervor.</p></div>"
"<div><p>\"Joseph Sheppard has been favorably compared to practically every Renaissance master…he is without peer among modern realists for his ability to impart a warm verisimilitude to the figure.\" — <em>Artspeak</em> <i>magazine</i></p><p>\nIn this highly praised guidebook, Joseph Sheppard, a versatile and influential artist and teacher who is widely recognized as a master of figure drawing, introduces an innovative approach to drawing the human form. Beginning by reviewing the basics of anatomy, he makes his principal focus the specifics of surface anatomy.<br>\nRather than depicting in detail the muscles and bone that lie beneath the skin, as do most books on artistic anatomy, this book concentrates on how the position and movement of muscles and bones affect the surface forms of live models. The effects are masterfully demonstrated in over 170 of Joseph Sheppard's own drawings of many different live models in front, back, and side views, and in various standing, sitting, kneeling, crouching, reclining, and twisting poses.<br>\nEach drawing is accompanied by two diagrams, one for bones, one for muscles, which specifically show how surface forms are created by the definitive shapes beneath the skin. The superb quality of Joseph Sheppard's drawings, the wide range of poses he illustrates, and the effectiveness of his approach in this book — now in its first paperback edition — will help artists at all levels improve and refine their skills in drawing the living figure.  </p></div>"

"<p>From time to time, perhaps a few times each century, a revolution occurs that questions some of our basic beliefs and sweeps across otherwise well guarded disciplinary boundaries. These are the periods when science is fun, when new paradigms have to be formulated, and when young scientists can do serious work without first having to acquire all the knowledge of their teachers. The emergence of nonlinear science appears to be one such revolution. In a surprising manner, this new science has disclosed a number of misconceptions in our traditional understanding of determinism. In particular, it has been shown that the notion of predictability, according to which the trajectory of a system can be precisely determined if one knows the equations of motion and the initial conditions, is related to textbook examples of simple; integrable systems. This predictability does not extend to nonlinear, conservative systems in general. Dissipative systems can also show unpredictability, provided that the motion is sustained by externally supplied energy and/or resources. These discoveries, and the associated discovery that even relatively simple nonlinear systems can show extremely complex behavior, have brought about an unprecedented feeling of common interest among scientists from many different disciplines. During the last decade or two we have come to understand that there are universal routes to chaos, we have learned about stretching and folding, and we have discovered the beautiful fractal geometry underlying chaotic attractors.</p>"

"<div><p>Most tasks require a person or an automated system to reason -- to reach conclusions based on available information. The framework of probabilistic graphical models, presented in this book, provides a general approach for this task. The approach is model-based, allowing interpretable models to be constructed and then manipulated by reasoning algorithms. These models can also be learned automatically from data, allowing the approach to be used in cases where manually constructing a model is difficult or even impossible. Because uncertainty is an inescapable aspect of most real-world applications, the book focuses on probabilistic models, which make the uncertainty explicit and provide models that are more faithful to reality.  </p>\n<p>\"Probabilistic Graphical Models\" discusses a variety of models, spanning Bayesian networks, undirected Markov networks, discrete and continuous models, and extensions to deal with dynamical systems and relational data. For each class of models, the text describes the three fundamental cornerstones: representation, inference, and learning, presenting both basic concepts and advanced techniques. Finally, the book considers the use of the proposed framework for causal reasoning and decision making under uncertainty. The main text in each chapter provides the detailed technical development of the key ideas. Most chapters also include boxes with additional material: skill boxes, which describe techniques; case study boxes, which discuss empirical cases related to the approach described in the text, including applications in computer vision, robotics, natural language understanding, and computational biology; and concept boxes, which present significant concepts drawn from the material in the chapter.

The book journeys from the first version of the theory (the so-called dual resonance model) in the late sixties, as an attempt to describe the physics of strong interactions outside the framework of quantum field theory, to its reinterpretation around the mid-seventies as a quantum theory of gravity unified with the other forces, and its successive developments up to the superstring revolution in 1984. Providing important background information to current debates on the theory, this book is essential reading for students and researchers in physics, as well as historians and philosophers of science.</p>"
"<p class=\"description\">G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are heptahelical transmembrane receptors that convert extra-cellular stimuli into intra-cellular signaling, and ultimately into biological responses. Since GPCRs are natural targets for approximately 40% of all modern medicines, it is not surprising that they have been the subject of intense research. Notwithstanding the amount of data generated over the years, discovering ligands of these receptors with optimal therapeutic properties is not straightforward and has certainly been hampered for years by the lack of high-resolution structural information about these receptors. Luckily, there has been a steady increase of high-resolution crystal structures of these receptors since 2007, and this information, integrated with dynamic inferences from computational and experimental methods, holds great potential for the discovery of new, improved drugs. This book, which provides, for the first time, state-of-the-art views on modeling and simulation of GPCRs, is divided into 4 parts. In the first part, the impact of currently available GPCR crystal structures on structural modeling is discussed extensively as are critical insights from simulations in the second part of the book. The third part reports recent progress in rational ligand discovery and mathematical modeling, whereas the fourth part provides an overview of bioinformatics tools and resources that are available for GPCRs.</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">Quantum field theory is arguably the most far-reaching and beautiful physical theory ever constructed, with aspects more stringently tested and verified to greater precision than any other theory in physics. Unfortunately, the subject has gained a notorious reputation for difficulty, with forbidding looking mathematics and a peculiar diagrammatic language described in an array of unforgiving, weighty textbooks aimed firmly at aspiring professionals. However, quantum field theory is too important, too beautiful, and too engaging to be restricted to the professionals. This book on quantum field theory is designed to be different. It is written by experimental physicists and aims to provide the interested amateur with a bridge from undergraduate physics to quantum field theory. The imagined reader is a gifted amateur, possessing a curious and adaptable mind, looking to be told an entertaining and intellectually stimulating story, but who will not feel patronised if a few mathematical niceties are spelled out in detail. Using numerous worked examples, diagrams, and careful physically motivated explanations, this book will smooth the path towards understanding the radically different and revolutionary view of the physical world that quantum field theory provides, and which all physicists should have the opportunity to experience.</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">Computational neuroscience is the theoretical study of the brain to uncover the principles and mechanisms that guide the development, organization, information processing, and mental functions of the nervous system. Although not a new area, it is only recently that enough knowledge has been gathered to establish computational neuroscience as a scientific discipline in its own right. Given the complexity of the field, and its increasing importance in progressing our understanding of how the brain works, there has long been a need for an introductory text on what is often assumed to be an impenetrable topic. The new edition of Fundamentals of Computational Neuroscience build on the success and strengths of the first edition. It introduces the theoretical foundations of neuroscience with a focus on the nature of information processing in the brain. The book covers the introduction and motivation of simplified models of neurons that are suitable for exploring information processing in large brain-like networks. Additionally, it introduces several fundamental network architectures and discusses their relevance for information processing in the brain, giving some examples of models of higher-order cognitive functions to demonstrate the advanced insight that can be gained with such studies. Each chapter starts by introducing its topic with experimental facts and conceptual questions related to the study of brain function. An additional feature is the inclusion of simple Matlab programs that can be used to explore many of the mechanisms explained in the book. An accompanying webpage includes programs for download. The book will be the essential text for anyone in the brain sciences who wants to get to grips with this topic.</p>"
"<p class=\"description\">\"Scientists other than quantum physicists often fail to comprehend the enormity of the conceptual change wrought by quantum theory in our basic conception of the nature of matter,\" writes Henry Stapp. Stapp is a leading quantum physicist who has given particularly careful thought to the implications of the theory that lies at the heart of modern physics. In this book, which contains several of his key papers as well as new material, he focuses on the problem of consciousness and explains how quantum mechanics allows causally effective conscious thought to be combined in a natural way with the physical brain made of neurons and atoms. The book is divided into four sections. The first consists of an extended introduction. Key foundational and somewhat more technical papers are included in the second part, together with a clear exposition of the \"orthodox\" interpretation of quantum mechanics. The third part addresses, in a non-technical fashion, the implications of the theory for some of the most profound questions that mankind has contemplated: How does the world come to be just what it is and not something else? How should humans view themselves in a quantum universe? What will be the impact on society of the revised scientific image of the nature of man? The final part contains a mathematical appendix for the specialist and a glossary of important terms and ideas for the interested layman. This third edition has been significantly expanded with two new chapters covering the author's most recent work.</p>"
"<p>During its forty year lifespan, string theory has always had the power to divide, being called both a 'theory of everything' and a 'theory of nothing'. Critics have even questioned whether it qualifies as a scientific theory at all. This book adopts an objective stance, standing back from the question of the \"truth\"\"or falsity\" of string theory and instead focusing on how it came to be and how it came to occupy its present position in physics. An unexpectedly rich history is revealed, with deep connections to our most well-established physical theories. Fully self-contained and written in a lively fashion, the book will appeal to a wide variety of readers from novice to specialist.</p>"

"<p>G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of cell-surface receptors, with more than 800 members identified thus far in the human genome. They regulate the function of most cells in the body, and represent approximately 3% of the genes in the human genome. These receptors respond to a wide variety of structurally diverse ligands, ranging from small molecules, such as biogenic amines, nucleotides and ions, to lipids, peptides, proteins, and even light. Ligands (agonists and antagonists) acting on GPCRs are important in the treatment of numerous diseases, including cardiovascular and mental disorders, retinal degeneration, cancer, and AIDS. It is estimated that these receptors represent about one third of the actual identified targets of clinically used drugs. The determination of rhodopsin crystal structure and, more recently, of opsin, 1 and 2 adrenergic and A2A adenosine receptors provides both academia and industry with extremely valuable data for a better understanding of the molecular determinants of receptor function and a more reliable rationale for drug design. GPCR structure and function constitutes a hot topic. The book, which lies between the fields of chemical biology, molecular pharmacology and medicinal chemistry, is divided into three parts. The first part considers what receptor structures tell us about the mechanism of receptor activation. Part II focuses on receptor function. It discusses what the data from biophysical and mutational studies, and the analysis of the interactions of the receptor with ligands and regulator proteins, tell us about the process of signal transduction. The final part, on modelling and simulation, details new insights on the link between structure and mechanism and their implications in drug design.</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">Over the last decade, the study of complex networks has expanded across diverse scientific fields. Increasingly, science is concerned with the structure, behavior, and evolution of complex systems ranging from cells to ecosystems. Modern network approaches are beginning to reveal fundamental principles of brain architecture and function, and in Networks of the Brain, Olaf Sporns describes how the integrative nature of brain function can be illuminated from a complex network perspective. Highlighting the many emerging points of contact between neuroscience and network science, the book serves to introduce network theory to neuroscientists and neuroscience to those working on theoretical network models. Brain networks span the microscale of individual cells and synapses and the macroscale of cognitive systems and embodied cognition. Sporns emphasizes how networks connect levels of organization in the brain and how they link structure to function. In order to keep the book accessible and focused on the relevance to neuroscience of network approaches, he offers an informal and nonmathematical treatment of the subject. After describing the basic concepts of network theory and the fundamentals of brain connectivity, Sporns discusses how network approaches can reveal principles of brain architecture. He describes new links between network anatomy and function and investigates how networks shape complex brain dynamics and enable adaptive neural computation. The book documents the rapid pace of discovery and innovation while tracing the historical roots of the field. The study of brain connectivity has already opened new avenues of study in neuroscience. Networks of the Brain offers a synthesis of the sciences of complex networks and the brain that will be an essential foundation for future research.</p>"

"<p>The book attempts to provide an introduction to quantum field theory emphasizing conceptual issues frequently neglected in more \"utilitarian\" treatments of the subject. The book is divided into four parts, entitled respectively \"Origins,\" \"Dynamics,\" \"Symmetries,\" and \"Scales.\" The emphasis is conceptual - the aim is to build the theory up systematically from some clearly stated foundational concepts - and therefore to a large extent anti-historical, but two historical Chapters (\"Origins\") are included to situate quantum field theory in the larger context of modern physical theories. The three remaining sections of the book follow a step by step reconstruction of this framework beginning with just a few basic assumptions: relativistic invariance, the basic principles of quantum mechanics, and the prohibition of physical action at a distance embodied in the clustering principle. The Dynamics\" section of the book lays out the basic structure of quantum field theory arising from the sequential insertion of quantum-mechanical, relativistic and locality constraints. The central role of symmetries in relativistic quantum field theories is explored in the third section of the book, while in the final section, entitled \"Scales,\" we explore in detail the feature of quantum field theories most critical for their enormous phenomenological success - the scale separation property embodied by the renormalization group properties of a theory defined by an effective local Lagrangian. <br>\nThe book includes a wide range of problems at the end of the chapters.

"<p class=\"description\">For decades biology has focused on decoding cellular processes one gene at a time, but many of the most pressing biological questions, as well as diseases such as cancer and heart disease, are related to complex systems involving the interaction of hundreds, or even thousands, of gene products and other factors.

This innovative approach builds intuition about the strengths and weaknesses of each method and becomes critical in the book’s second half, where much more complicated network models are addressed—including transcriptional, signaling, metabolic, and even integrated multi-network models.

"<p>There are many excellent computational biology resources now available for learning about methods that have been developed to address specific biological systems, but comparatively little attention has been paid to training aspiring computational biologists to handle new and unanticipated problems. This text is intended to fill that gap by teaching students how to reason about developing formal mathematical models of biological systems that are amenable to computational analysis. It collects in one place a selection of broadly useful models, algorithms, and theoretical analysis tools normally found scattered among many other disciplines. It thereby gives the aspiring student a bag of tricks that will serve him or her well in modeling problems drawn from numerous subfields of biology. These techniques are taught from the perspective of what the practitioner needs to know to use them effectively, supplemented with references for further reading on more advanced use of each method covered. The text, which grew out of a class taught at Carnegie Mellon University, covers models for optimization, simulation and sampling, and parameter tuning. These topics provide a general framework for learning how to formulate mathematical models of biological systems, what techniques are available to work with these models, and how to fit the models to particular systems. Their application is illustrated by many examples drawn from a variety of biological disciplines and several extended case studies that show how the methods described have been applied to real problems in biology.</p>"

"<p>This comprehensive book not only introduces the C and C++ programming languages but also shows how to use them in the numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). It leads the reader through the entire solution process, from the original PDE, through the discretization stage, to the numerical solution of the resulting algebraic system. The well-debugged and tested code segments implement the numerical methods efficiently and transparently. Basic and advanced numerical methods are introduced and implemented easily and efficiently in a unified object-oriented approach. It introduces a unified approach for the implementation of complex mathematical objects, such as unstructured mesh, sparse matrix, and multigrid hierarchy, often used in numerical modeling, where the high level of abstraction available in C++ is particularly useful, Included is all the required background in programming, PDEs, and numerical methods, and an elementary background in linear algebra and calculus. Useful exercises and solutions conclude each chapter.</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">Long ago, when Alexander the Great asked the mathematician Menaechmus for a crash course in geometry, he got the famous reply There is no royal road to mathematics. Where there was no shortcut for Alexander, there is no shortcut for us. Still, the fact that we have access to computers and mature programming languages means that there are avenues for us that were denied to the kings and emperors of yore. The purpose of this book is to teach logic and mathematical reasoning in practice, and to connect logical reasoning with computer programming in Haskell. Haskell emerged in the 1990s as a standard for lazy functional programming, a programming style where arguments are evaluated only when the value is actually needed. Haskell is a marvelous demonstration tool for logic and maths because its functional character allows implementations to remain very close to the concepts that get implemented, while the laziness permits smooth handling of infinite data structures. This book does not assume the reader to have previous experience with either programming or construction of formal proofs, but acquaintance with mathematical notation, at the level of secondary school mathematics is presumed. Everything one needs to know about mathematical reasoning or programming is explained as we go along. After proper digestion of the material in this book, the reader will be able to write interesting programs, reason about their correctness, and document them in a clear fashion. The reader will also have learned how to set up mathematical proofs in a structured way, and how to read and digest mathematical proofs written by others. This is the updated, expanded, and corrected second edition of a much-acclaimed textbook. Praise for the first edition: Doets and van Eijck s The Haskell Road to Logic, Maths and Programming is an astonishingly extensive and accessible textbook on logic, maths, and Haskell.

"<div><p>I am writing this book because I had a hard time learning Haskell.<br>\nIt doesn't have to be that way. I've spent the last couple years actively teaching Haskell online and in person. Along the way, I started keeping notes on exercises and methods of teaching specific concepts and techniques in Haskell that eventually turned into my guide for learning haskell. That experience led me to work on this book.  </p>\n<p>If you are new to programming entirely, Haskell is a great first language. You may have noticed the trend of \"Functional Programming in [Imperative Language]\" books and tutorials and learning Haskell gets right to the heart of what functional programming is. Languages such as Java are gradually adopting functional concepts, but most such languages were not designed to be functional languages, after all. We would not encourage you to learn Haskell as an only language, but because Haskell is a pure functional language, it is a fertile environment for mastering functional programming techniques. That way of thinking and problem solving is useful, no matter what other languages you might know or learn.  </p>\n<p>Haskell is not a difficult language to use. Quite the opposite. I'm now able to tackle problems that I couldn't have tackled when I was primarily a Clojure, Common Lisp, or Python user. Haskell is difficult to teach effectively.</p></div>"
"<p>Professor John D. Roberts published a highly readable book on Molecular Orbital Calculations directed toward chemists in 1962. That timely book is the model for this book. The audience this book is directed toward are senior undergraduate and beginning graduate students as well as practicing bench chemists who have a desire to develop conceptual tools for understanding chemical phenomena. Although, ab initio and more advanced semi-empirical MO methods are regarded as being more reliable than HMO in an absolute sense, there is good evidence that HMO provides reliable relative answers particularly when comparing related molecular species. Thus, HMO can be used to rationalize electronic structure in 1t-systems, aromaticity, and the shape use HMO to gain insight of simple molecular orbitals. Experimentalists still into subtle electronic interactions for interpretation of UV and photoelectron spectra. Herein, it will be shown that one can use graph theory to streamline their HMO computational efforts and to arrive at answers quickly without the aid of a group theory or a computer program of which the experimentalist has no understanding. The merging of mathematical graph theory with chemical theory is the formalization of what most chemists do in a more or less intuitive mode. Chemists currently use graphical images to embody chemical information in compact form which can be transformed into algebraical sets. Chemical graph theory provides simple descriptive interpretations of complicated quantum mechanical calculations and is, thereby, in-itself-by-itself an important discipline of study.</p>"

The first three volumes of this work have long comprised a unique and invaluable resource in programming theory and practice.

Knuth has obviously thought long and hard about which topics and results are most central and important, and then, what are the most intuitive and succinct ways of presenting that material.

Combinatorial searching is a rich and important topic, and Knuth has too much to say about it that is new, interesting, and useful to fit into a single volume, or two, or maybe even three.

"<div>Vast quantities of data are produced every second. In this context, neural networks become a powerful technique to extract useful knowledge from large amounts of raw, seemingly unrelated data. One of the most preferred languages for neural network programming is Java as it is easier to write code using it, and most of the most popular neural network packages around already exist for Java. This makes it a versatile programming language for neural networks. <br>This book gives you a complete walkthrough of the process of developing basic to advanced practical examples based on neural networks with Java. <br>You will first learn the basics of neural networks and their process of learning. We then focus on what Perceptrons are and their features. Next, you will implement self-organizing maps using the concepts you’ve learned. Furthermore, you will learn about some of the applications that are presented in this book such as weather forecasting, disease diagnosis, customer profiling, and characters recognition (OCR). Finally, you will learn methods to optimize and adapt neural networks in real time. <br>All the examples generated in the book are provided in the form of illustrative source code, which merges object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and neural network features to enhance your learning experience.\n</div>"

"<p>The evolutionary history of species is traditionally represented using a rooted phylogenetic tree. However, when reticulate events such as hybridization, horizontal gene transfer or recombination are believed to be involved, phylogenetic networks that can accommodate non-treelike evolution have an important role to play. This book provides the first interdisciplinary overview of phylogenetic networks. Beginning with a concise introduction to both phylogenetic trees and phylogenetic networks, the fundamental concepts and results are then presented for both rooted and unrooted phylogenetic networks. Current approaches and algorithms available for computing phylogenetic networks from different types of datasets are then discussed, accompanied by examples of their application to real biological datasets. The book also summarises the algorithms used for drawing phylogenetic networks, along with the existing software for their computation and evaluation. All datasets, examples and other additional information and links are available from the book's companion website at <a href=\"http://www.phylogenetic-networks.org\">www.phylogenetic-networks.org</a>.</p>"

"<p>Phylogenies (evolutionary trees) are basic to thinking about and analyzing differences between species. Statistical, computational, and algorithmic work on them has been ongoing for four decades, with great advances in understanding. Yet no book has summarized this work until now. Inferring Phylogenies explains clearly the assumptions and logic of making inferences about phylogenies, and using them to make inferences about evolutionary processes. It is an essential text and reference for anyone who wants to understand how phylogenies are reconstructed and how they are used. As phylogenies are inferred with various kinds of data, this book concentrates on some of the central ones: discretely coded characters, molecular sequences, gene frequencies, and quantitative traits. Also covered are restriction sites, RAPDs, and microsatellites. Inferring Phylogenies is intended for graduate-level courses, assuming some knowledge of statistics, mathematics (calculus and fundamental matrix algebra), molecular sequences, and quantitative genetics.</p>"

"<p>The second edition of Duane Bailey's Java Structures considers the design, implementation, and use of data structures using Java 2. The structure package, a collection of nearly 100 different classes implementing a wide variety of data structures, has been the basis of Java Structures for more than five years. Thousands of faculty, students, researchers, industrial and recreational programmers have investigated this lean and well tested approach to data structure design. In this edition, the text develops a heavily tested package that is independent of but consistent with the Collection package offered by Sun. In many cases, the variety of implementations provides the programmer choices of data structure that are not available with the Collection system. For those curricula that make use of the Collection package, the structure package can be easily integrated into existing applications. All classes are fully documented and make consistent use of pre- and post-conditioning, and include support for assertion testing. The second edition also brings a wealth of new resources, including a large number of new and original exercises and drill problems. consideration of subtle issues by students. Perhaps, the most innovative feature (first found in Bailey's Java Elements) is the inclusion of more than a dozen original lab exercises that focus on interesting and often classic problems of computer science. All code for the book's examples, documentation, and the Structure package is posted on the book's website.</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">Heidi Heilig's debut teen fantasy sweeps from modern-day New York City, to nineteenth-century Hawaii, to places of myth and legend. Sixteen-year-old Nix has sailed across the globe and through centuries aboard her time-traveling father's ship. But when he gambles with her very existence, it all may be about to end. The Girl from Everywhere, the first of two books, blends fantasy, history, and a modern sensibility. Its witty, fast-paced dialogue, breathless adventure, multicultural cast, and enchanting romance will dazzle readers of Sabaa Tahir, Rae Carson, and Rachel Hartman.Nix's life began in Honolulu in 1868. Since then she has traveled to mythic Scandinavia, a land from the tales of One Thousand and One Nights, modern-day New York City, and many more places both real and imagined. As long as he has a map, Nix's father can sail his ship, The Temptation, to any place, any time. But now he's uncovered the one map he's always sought—1868 Honolulu, before Nix's mother died in childbirth. Nix's life—her entire existence—is at stake. No one knows what will happen if her father changes the past. It could erase Nix's future, her dreams, her adventures . . . her connection with the charming Persian thief, Kash, who's been part of their crew for two years. If Nix helps her father reunite with the love of his life, it will cost her her own.</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs has had a dramatic impact on computer science curricula over the past decade. This long-awaited revision contains changes throughout the text. There are new implementations of most of the major programming systems in the book, including the interpreters and compilers, and the authors have incorporated many small changes that reflect their experience teaching the course at MIT since the first edition was published. A new theme has been introduced that emphasizes the central role played by different approaches to dealing with time in computational models: objects with state, concurrent programming, functional programming and lazy evaluation, and nondeterministic programming. There are new example sections on higher-order procedures in graphics and on applications of stream processing in numerical programming, and many new exercises. In addition, all the programs have been reworked to run in any Scheme implementation that adheres to the IEEE standard.</p>"

"<p>Prime numbers are beautiful, mysterious, and beguiling mathematical objects. The mathematician Bernhard Riemann made a celebrated conjecture about primes in 1859, the so-called Riemann Hypothesis, which remains to be one of the most important unsolved problems in mathematics. Through the deep insights of the authors, this book introduces primes and explains the Riemann Hypothesis. Students with minimal mathematical background and scholars alike will enjoy this comprehensive discussion of primes. The first part of the book will inspire the curiosity of a general reader with an accessible explanation of the key ideas. The exposition of these ideas is generously illuminated by computational graphics that exhibit the key concepts and phenomena in enticing detail. Readers with more mathematical experience will then go deeper into the structure of primes and see how the Riemann Hypothesis relates to Fourier analysis using the vocabulary of spectra. Readers with a strong mathematical background will be able to connect these ideas to historical formulations of the Riemann Hypothesis.</p>"

"<p>This text gives a brisk and engaging introduction to the mathematics behind the recently established field of Applied Topology. Over a century of development of principles and techniques in algebraic topology has of late crossed over to a variety of application domains. This text gives a completely novel introduction to these methods in the context of the applications. \"Elementary Applied Topology\" is short (250 pp. plus bibliography and index) and richly illustrated, with 268 figures. It is perfect for both self-study, and as the basis for a course in applied topology. This book is also well-suited for use as a supplementary text in a more traditional algebraic topology course, providing both context and motivation for the tools to be learned. The progression of mathematical techniques is a fresh approach. The book begins with a quick trip through manifolds and cell complexes. The segue to algebraic topology comes in the form of the Euler characteristic and the Euler calculus born from it. Passing from this to homology, exact sequences, and cohomology sets the stage for the innovative content to come. This is comprised of modern Morse theory (including discrete Morse theory, Conley index, and stratified Morse theory), sheaf theory (with an emphasis on cellular sheaves and cosheaves), and, finally, category theory and categorification. Every tool and topic is paired with an application. These range in scope across the biological, economic, engineering, material, physical, and statistical sciences. Of particular note are the applications to topological data analysis, including persistent homology and barcodes. \"Elementary Applied Topology\" is the first comprehensive text on applied algebraic topology for students of all mathematical sciences.</p>"

"<p>The sequencing of the human genome involved thousands of scientists but used relatively few tools. Today, obtaining sequences is simpler, but aligning the sequences—making sure that sequences from one source are properly compared to those from other sources—remains a complicated but underappreciated aspect of comparative molecular biology. This volume, the first to focus on this crucial step in analyzing sequence data, is about the practice of alignment, the procedures by which alignments are established, and more importantly, how the outcomes of any alignment algorithm should be interpreted.

"<p>Analysis (sometimes called Real Analysis or Advanced Calculus) is a core subject in most undergraduate mathematics degrees. It is elegant, clever and rewarding to learn, but it is hard. Even the best students find it challenging, and those who are unprepared often find it incomprehensible at first. This book aims to ensure that no student need be unprepared. It is not like other Analysis books. It is not a textbook containing standard content. Rather, it isdesigned to be read before arriving at university and/or before starting an Analysis course, or as a companion text once a course is begun. It provides a friendly and readable introduction to the subject by building on the students existing understanding of six key topics: sequences, series, continuity,differentiability, integrability and the real numbers. It explains how mathematicians develop and use sophisticated formal versions of these ideas, and provides a detailed introduction to the central definitions, theorems and proofs, pointing out typical areas of difficulty and confusion and explaining how to overcome these. The book also provides study advice focused on the skills that students need if they are to build on this introduction and learn successfully in their own Analysis courses: it explains how to understand definitions, theorems and proofs by relating them to examples and diagrams, how to think productively about proofs, and how theories are taught in lectures and books on advanced mathematics. It also offers practical guidance on strategies for effective study planning. The advice throughout isresearch based and is presented in an engaging style that will be accessible to students who are new to advanced abstract mathematics.</p>"

"<p>Nature can be a great source of inspiration for artificial intelligence algorithms because its technology is considerably more advanced than our own. Among its wonders are strong AI, nanotechnology, and advanced robotics. Nature can therefore serve as a guide for real-life problem solving. In this book, you will encounter algorithms influenced by ants, bees, genomes, birds, and cells that provide practical methods for many types of AI situations. Although nature is the muse behind the methods, we are not duplicating its exact processes. The complex behaviors in nature merely provide inspiration in our quest to gain new insights about data. Artificial Intelligence for Humans is a book series meant to teach AI to those readers who lack an extensive mathematical background. The reader only needs knowledge of basic college algebra and computer programming. Additional topics are thoroughly explained. Every chapter also includes a programming example.

"<p class=\"description\">Combining concepts from topology and algorithms, this book delivers what its title promises: an introduction to the field of computational topology. Starting with motivating problems in both mathematics and computer science and building up from classic topics in geometric and algebraic topology, the third part of the text advances to persistent homology. This point of view is critically important in turning a mostly theoretical field of mathematics into one that is relevant to a multitude of disciplines in the sciences and engineering. The main approach is the discovery of topology through algorithms. The book is ideal for teaching a graduate or advanced undergraduate course in computational topology, as it develops all the background of both the mathematical and algorithmic aspects of the subject from first principles. Thus the text could serve equally well in a course taught in a mathematics department or computer science department.</p>"

"<p>This textbook takes an innovative approach to the teaching of classical mechanics, emphasizing the development of general but practical intellectual tools to support the analysis of nonlinear Hamiltonian systems. The development is organized around a progressively more sophisticated analysis of particular natural systems and weaves examples throughout the presentation. Explorations of phenomena such as transitions to chaos, nonlinear resonances, and resonance overlap to help the student to develop appropriate analytic tools for understanding. Computational algorithms communicate methods used in the analysis of dynamical phenomena. Expressing the methods of mechanics in a computer language forces them to be unambiguous and computationally effective. Once formalized as a procedure, a mathematical idea also becomes a tool that can be used directly to compute results.The student actively explores the motion of systems through computer simulation and experiment. This active exploration is extended to the mathematics. The requirement that the computer be able to interpret any expression provides strict and immediate feedback as to whether an expression is correctly formulated. The interaction with the computer uncovers and corrects many deficiencies in understanding.</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">Physics is naturally expressed in mathematical language. Students new to the subject must simultaneously learn an idiomatic mathematical language and the content that is expressed in that language. It is as if they were asked to read Les Misérables while struggling with French grammar. This book offers an innovative way to learn the differential geometry needed as a foundation for a deep understanding of general relativity or quantum field theory as taught at the college level.The approach taken by the authors (and used in their classes at MIT for many years) differs from the conventional one in several ways, including an emphasis on the development of the covariant derivative and an avoidance of the use of traditional index notation for tensors in favor of a semantically richer language of vector fields and differential forms. But the biggest single difference is the authors' integration of computer programming into their explanations. By programming a computer to interpret a formula, the student soon learns whether or not a formula is correct. Students are led to improve their program, and as a result improve their understanding.</p>"
"<p class=\"description\">The goal of The Reasoned Schemer is to help the functional programmer think logically and the logic programmer think functionally. The authors of The Reasoned Schemer believe that logic programming is a natural extension of functional programming, and they demonstrate this by extending the functional language Scheme with logical constructs -- thereby combining the benefits of both styles. The extension encapsulates most of the ideas in the logic programming language Prolog. The pedagogical method of The Reasoned Schemer is a series of questions and answers, which proceed with the characteristic humor that marked The Little Schemer and The Seasoned Schmer. Familiarity with a functional language or with the first eight chapters of The Little Schemer is assumed. Adding logic capabilities required the introduction of new forms. The authors' goal is to show to what extent writing logic programs is the same as writing functional programs using these forms. In this way, the reader of The Reasoned Schemer will come to understand how simple logic programming is and how easy it is to define functions that behave like relations.</p>"
"<p>The notion that “thinking about computing is one of the most exciting things the human mind can do” sets both <em>The Little Schemer</em> (formerly known as <em>The Little LISPer</em>) and its new companion volume, <em>The Seasoned Schemer</em>, apart from other books on LISP. The authors' enthusiasm for their subject is compelling as they present abstract concepts in a humorous and easy-to-grasp fashion. Together, these books will open new doors of thought to anyone who wants to find out what computing is really about. <em>The Little Schemer</em> introduces computing as an extension of arithmetic and algebra; things that everyone studies in grade school and high school. It introduces programs as recursive functions and briefly discusses the limits of what computers can do. The authors use the programming language Scheme, and interesting foods to illustrate these abstract ideas. The Seasoned Schemer informs the reader about additional dimensions of computing: functions as values, change of state, and exceptional cases. <em>The Little LISPer</em> has been a popular introduction to LISP for many years. It had appeared in French and Japanese. <em>The Little Schemer</em> and <em>The Seasoned Schemer</em> are worthy successors and will prove equally popular as textbooks for Scheme courses as well as companion texts for any complete introductory course in Computer Science.</p>"
"<p>Category theory was invented in the 1940s to unify and synthesize different areas in mathematics, and it has proven remarkably successful in enabling powerful communication between disparate fields and subfields within mathematics. This book shows that category theory can be useful outside of mathematics as a rigorous, flexible, and coherent modeling language throughout the sciences. Information is inherently dynamic; the same ideas can be organized and reorganized in countless ways, and the ability to translate between such organizational structures is becoming increasingly important in the sciences. Category theory offers a unifying framework for information modeling that can facilitate the translation of knowledge between disciplines. Written in an engaging and straightforward style, and assuming little background in mathematics, the book is rigorous but accessible to non-mathematicians. Using databases as an entry to category theory, it begins with sets and functions, then introduces the reader to notions that are fundamental in mathematics: monoids, groups, orders, and graphs -- categories in disguise. After explaining the \"big three\" concepts of category theory -- categories, functors, and natural transformations -- the book covers other topics, including limits, colimits, functor categories, sheaves, monads, and operads. The book explains category theory by examples and exercises rather than focusing on theorems and proofs. It includes more than 300 exercises, with solutions. <em>Category Theory for the Sciences</em> is intended to create a bridge between the vast array of mathematical concepts used by mathematicians and the models and frameworks of such scientific disciplines as computation, neuroscience, and physics.</p>"

The author gives a self-contained presentation of the mathematical concepts from a computer scientist's point of view, combining point set topology, algebraic topology, group theory, differential manifolds, and Morse theory. He also presents some recent advances in the area, including topological persistence and hierarchical Morse complexes. Throughout, the focus is on computational challenges and on presenting algorithms and data structures when appropriate.</p>"

Elle aimait s'habiller en noir, elle s'asseyait d'une façon que n'avait personne, se penchait pour m'écouter, la joue sur sa main, le coude sur le genou. Je lui avais dit : \" Vous fumez ? \", et elle avait éteint sa cigarette, non, c'était pure nervosité.

"<p class=\"description\">Robert A. Heinlein was the most influential science fiction writer of his era, an influence so large that, as Samuel R. Delany notes, \"modern critics attempting to wrestle with that influence find themselves dealing with an object rather like the sky or an ocean.\" He won the Hugo Award for best novel four times, a record that still stands. The Moon is a Harsh Mistress was the last of these Hugo-winning novels, and it is widely considered his finest work.It is a tale of revolution, of the rebellion of the former Lunar penal colony against the Lunar Authority that controls it from Earth. It is the tale of the disparate people--a computer technician, a vigorous young female agitator, and an elderly academic--who become the rebel movement's leaders. And it is the story of Mike, the supercomputer whose sentience is known only to this inner circle, and who for reasons of his own is committed to the revolution's ultimate success.The Moon is a Harsh Mistress is one of the high points of modern science fiction, a novel bursting with politics, humanity, passion, innovative technical speculation, and a firm belief in the pursuit of human freedom.The Moon is a Harsh Mistress is the winner of the 1967 Hugo Award for Best Novel.</p>"

Born with a frozen heart, Jack is near death when his mother abandons him to the care of Dr. Madeleine—witch doctor, midwife, protector of orphans—who saves Jack by placing a cuckoo clock in his chest. And it is in her orphanage that Jack grows up among tear-filled flasks, eggs containing memories, and a man with a musical spine.  </p>\n<p>As Jack gets older, Dr. Madeleine warns him that his heart is too fragile for strong emotions: he must never, ever fall in love. And, of course, this is exactly what he does: on his tenth birthday and with head-over-heels abandon.

"<p>G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise an important protein family, which is involved in signal transduction in the cell. Besides that a large number of drugs, available on market, address GPCRs. For an efficient and improved development of appropriate drugs, molecular modelling of GPCRs is – in order to understand the ligand-receptor interactions and functionality of GPCRs on molecular level - an important tool. The book “Modelling of GPCRs – a practical handbook” is focussed onto a practical introduction into molecular modelling of GPCRs. This book is very useful for beginners in GPCR modelling, but also addresses the advanced GPCR modeller: On the one hand, the book introduces  principles of GPCR modelling, including extensive examples. On the other hand, detailed outlooks onto advanced GPCR modelling techniques are presented. Furthermore, the book includes important data, like information about crystal structures in a summarized manner or amino acid sequences, which are essential for GPCR modelling in general. Due to an increase in efficacy and data handling most modellers use LINUX as operating system. To address this, a summary of most important LINUX commands with examples is presented within the book.</p>"

"<p class=\"description\">Some books on algorithms are rigorous but incomplete; others cover  masses                 of material but lack rigor. Introduction to  Algorithms uniquely combines rigor and                  comprehensiveness. The book covers a broad range of algorithms in depth,  yet makes                 their design and analysis accessible to all  levels of readers. Each chapter is                 relatively  self-contained and can be used as a unit of study. The algorithms are                  described in English and in a pseudocode designed to be  readable by anyone who has                 done a little programming.  The explanations have been kept elementary without                  sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor.The first edition  became a                 widely used text in universities worldwide as  well as the standard reference for                 professionals.

"<p>Molecular chaperones are a fundamental group of proteins that have been identified only relatively recently. They are key components of a protein quality machinery in the cell which insures that the folding process of any newly-synthesized polypeptide chain results in the formation of a properly folded protein and that the folded protein is maintained in an active conformation throughout its functional lifetime. Molecular chaperones have been shown to play essential roles in cell viability under both normal and stress conditions. Chaperones can also assist in the unfolding and degradation of misfolded proteins and in disaggregating preformed protein aggregates. Chaperones are also involved in other cellular functions including protein translocation across membranes, vesicle fusion events, and protein secretion. In recent years, tremendous advances have been made in our understanding of the biology, biochemistry, and biophysics of function of molecular chaperones. In addition, recent technical developments in the fields of proteomics and genomics allowed us to obtain a global view of chaperone interaction networks. Finally, there is now a growing interest in the role of molecular chaperones in diseases. This book will provide a comprehensive analysis of the structure and function of the diverse systems of molecular chaperones and their role in cell stress responses and in diseases from a global network perspective.</p>"

"<p>Digital Image Processing Using MATLAB is the first book to offer a balanced treatment of image processing fundamentals and the software principles used in their implementation. The book integrates material from the leading text, Digital Image Processing by Gonzalez and Woods, and the Image Processing Toolbox from The MathWorks, Inc., a leader in scientific computing. The Image Processing Toolbox provides a stable, well-supported software environment for addressing a broad range of applications in digital image processing. A unique feature of the book is its emphasis on showing how to enhance those tools by developing new code. This is important in image processing, an area that normally requires extensive experimental work in order to arrive at acceptable application solutions. Some Highlights: (1) This new edition is an extensive upgrade of the book. (2) Over 120 new MATLAB image processing functions are developed, a 40 % increase over existing functions in the Image Processing Toolbox. (3) Algorithms and MATLAB functions in the mainstream of digital image processing are discussed and implemented, including: Intensity transformations; spatial filtering; fuzzy image processing; filtering in the frequency domain; image restoration and reconstruction; geometric transformations and image registration; color image processing; wavelets; image and video compression; morphology; image segmentation; image representation and description; and object recognition. (4) In addition to a major revision of the topics from the first edition, features in this edition include new coverage of: The Radon transform; image processing functions based on function-generating functions (function factories); geometric transformations; image registration; color profiles and device-independent color conversions; functions for video compression; adaptive thresholding algorithms; new image features, including minimum-perimeter polygons and local (corner) features.</p>"
"<div><p>This monograph is the first easy-to-read-and-understand book on prion proteins' molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and on prions' molecular modelling (MM) constructions. It enables researchers to see what is crucial to the conformational change from normal cellular prion protein (PrPC) to diseased infectious prions (PrPSc), using MD and MM techniques. As we all know, prion diseases, caused by the body's own proteins, are invariably fatal and highly infectious neurodegenerative diseases effecting humans and almost all animals for a major public health concern. Prion contains no nucleic acids and it is a misshapen or conformation-changed protein that acts like an infectious agent; thus prion diseases are called protein structural conformational diseases.  </p>\n<p>PrPC is predominant in -helices but PrPSc are rich in -sheets in the form as amyloid fibrils; so very amenable to be studied by MD techniques. Through MD, studies on the protein structures and the structural conversion are very important for revealing secrets of prion diseases and for structure-based drug design or discovery. Rabbits, dogs, horses and buffaloes are reported to be the few low susceptibility species to prion diseases; this book's MD studies on these species are clearly helpful to understand the mechanism underlying the resistance to prion diseases. PrP(1-120) usually has no clear molecular structures; this book also studies this unstructured region through MD and especially MM techniques from the global optimization point of view.  </p>\n<p>This book is ideal for practitioners in computing of biophysics, biochemistry, biomedicine, bioinformatics, cheminformatics, materials science and engineering, applied mathematics and theoretical physics, information technology, operations research, biostatistics, etc. As an accessible introduction to these fields, this book is also ideal as a teaching material for students.  </p>\n<p>\"</p></div>"

"<p class=\"description\">\"Written by three experts in the field, Deep Learning is the only comprehensive book on the subject.\" -- Elon Musk, cochair of OpenAI; cofounder and CEO of Tesla and SpaceXDeep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms.
